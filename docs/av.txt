HYMN I

  

A prayer to Vachaspati for divine illumination and help.

[0100101]Now may Vachaspati assign to me the strength and powers of
   Those
   Who, wearing every shape and form, the triple seven, are
    wandering round.
 [0100102]Come thou again, Vachaspati, come with divine intelligence.
   Vasoshpati, repose thou here. In me be Knowledge, yea, in me.
 [0100103]Here, even here, spread sheltering arms like the two bow-ends
    strained with cord.
   This let Vachaspati confirm. In me be Knowledge, yea, in me.
 [0100104]Vachaspati hath been invoked: may he invite us in reply.
   May we adhere to Sacred Lore. Never may I be reft thereof.

HYMN II

  

A charm against dysentery

[0100201]We know the father of the shaft, Parjanya, liberal nourisher,
   Know well his mother: Prithivi, Earth with her manifold
    designs.
 [0100202]Do thou, O Bowstring, bend thyself around us: make my body
    stone.
   Firm in thy strength drive far away malignities and hateful
    things.
 [0100203]When, closely clinging round the wood, the bowstring sings
    triumph to the swift and whizzing arrow,
   Indra, ward off from us the shaft, the missile.
 [0100204]As in its flight the arrow's point hangs between earth and
    firmament,
   So stand this Munja grass between ailment and dysenteric ill!

HYMN III

  

A charm against constipation and suppression of urine

[0100301]We know the father of the shaft, Parjanya strong with hundred
    powers:
   By this may I bring health unto thy body: let the channels pour
    their burthen freely as of old.
 [0100302]We know the father of the shaft, Mitra, the Lord of hundred
    powers:
   By this, etc.
 [0100303]We know the father of the shaft, Varuna, strong with hundred
    powers: [p. a4]
   By this, etc.
 [0100304]We know the father of the shaft, the Moon endowed with
    hundred powers:
   By this, etc.
 [0100305]We know the father of the shaft, the Sun endowed with hundred
    powers:
   By this may I bring health unto thy body: let the channels pour
    their burthen freely as of old.
 [0100306]Whate'er hath gathered, as it flowed, in bowels, bladder, or in
    groins,
   Thus let the conduit, free from check, pour all its burthen as of
    old.
 [0100307]I lay the passage open as one cleaves the dam that bars the
    lake:
   Thus let, etc.
 [0100308]Now hath the portal been unclosed as, of the sea that holds the
    flood:
   Thus let, etc.
 [0100309]Even as the arrow flies away when loosened from the archer's
    bow,
   Thus let the burthen be discharged from channels that are checked
    no more.

    down a hundred times destroy them.

   Indra hath given me the lead: this verily repels the fiends.
 [0101603]This overcomes Vishkandha, -this drives the voracious fiends

   By means of this have I, o'erthrown all the Pisachi's demon

A prayer to fever, as a charm against his attacks

[0102501]When Agni blazed when he had pierced the Waters, whereat the
   Law-observers paid him homage,
   There, men assever, was thy loftiest birthplace: O Fever, yield-
    ing to our prayer avoid us.
 [0102502]If thou be fiery glow, or inflammation, or if thy birthplace call
    for chips of fuel,
   Rack is thy name, God of the sickly yellow! O Fever, yielding
    to our prayer avoid us.
 [0102503]Be thou distress, or agonizing torment, be thou the son King
   Varuna hath begotten,
   Rack isthy name, God of the sickly yellow! O Fever, yielding to
    our prayer avoid us.
 [0102504]I offer homage to the chilly Fever, to his fierce burning glow I
    offer homage. [p. a24]

    two days running.

 [0102602]Our friend be that Celestial Grace, Indra and Bhaga be our friends,
    and Savitar with splendid Wealth. [p. a25]
 [0102603]Thou, Offspring of the waterflood, ye Maruts, with your sun-

HYMN XXVII

  

A charm to obtain invisibility

[0102701]There on the bank those Vipers lie, thrice-seven, having cast
    their skins:
   Now we with their discarded sloughs bind close and cover up the
    eyes of the malicious highway thief.
 [0102702]Far let her go, cutting her way, brandishing, as it were, a club:
   Diverted be the new-born's mind: ne'er are the wicked
    prosperous.
 [0102703]Not many have had power enough; the feeble ones have not
    prevailed,
   Like scattered fragments of a reed: ne'er are the wicked pros-
    perous.
 [0102704]Go forward, feet, press quickly on, bring to the house of him
    who pays.
   Unconquered and unplundered, let Indranf, foremost, lead the
    way.

   Burning the Yatudhanas up, Kimidins, and deceitful ones.
 [0102802]Consume the Yatudhanas, God! meet the Kimidins with thy
    flame:
   Burn up the Yatudhanis as they face thee, thou whose path is
    black!
 [0102803]She who hath cursed us with a curse, or hath conceived a
    murderous sin;
   Or seized our son to take his blood, let her devour the child
    she bare.
 [0102804]Let her, the Yatudhani eat son, sister, and her daughter's.
    child.
   Now let the twain by turns destroy the wild-haired Yatudhanis-
    and crush down Arayis to the earth!

   That which gives breathing to the Plants is not on earth nor in,
    the heaven.
 [0103202]Their station, as of those who rest when weary, is in midmost air:
   The base whereon this world is built, the sages know or know
    it not.
 [0103203]What the two trembling hemispheres and ground produced and
    fashioned forth.
   This All, is ever fresh to-day, even as the currents of the sea.

    at rest.
   To Earth and all-possessing Heaven mine adoration have I paid.

    righteous and unrighteous dealing.
   They who took Agni as a germ, fair-coloured,--those Waters bring
    felicity and bless us!
 [0103303]Whom the Gods make their beverage in heaven, they who wax
    manifold in air's mid-region,
   They who took Agni as a germ, fair-coloured,--those Waters bring
    felicity and bless us!
 [0103304]Ye Waters, with auspicious eye behold me: touch ye my skin

    bring felicity and bless us.

A young man's love-charm

[0103400]1. From honey sprang this Plant to life; with honey now we dig

   Make us as sweet as honey, for from honey hast thou been pro-
    duced.
 [0103402]My tongue hath honey at the tip, and sweetest honey at the root: [p. a31]
   Thou yieldest to my wish and will, and shalt be mine and only
    mine.
 [0103403]My coming in is honey-sweet and honey-sweet, my going forth:
   My voice and words are sweet: I fain would be like honey in
    my look.
 [0103404]Sweeter am I than honey, yet more full of sweets than licorice:
   So mayst thou love me as a branch full of all sweets, and only me.
 [0103405]Around thee have I girt a zone of sugar-cane to banish hate.
   That thou mayst be in love with me, my darling never to depart.

BOOK II

  

HYMN I

  

Glorification of the prime cause of all things

[0200101]Vena beholds That Highest which lies hidden, wherein this All
    resumes one form and fashion.
   Thence Prisni milked all life that had existence: the hosts that
    know the light with songs extolled her.
 [0200102]Knowing Eternity, may the Gandharva declare to us that highest
    secret station.
   Three steps thereof lie hidden in the darkness: he who knows
    these shall be the father's father.
 [0200103]He is our kinsman, father, and begetter: he knows all beings
    and all Ordinances.
   He only gave the Gods their appellations: all creatures go to
    him to ask direction.
 [0200104]I have gone forth around the earth and heaven, I have approached
    the first-born Son of Order.
   He, putting voice, as 'twere, within the speaker, stands in the
    world, he, verily is Agni.
 [0200105]I round the circumjacent worlds have travelled to see the far-
    extended thread of Order.
   Wherein the Gods, obtaining life eternal, have risen upward to
    one common birthplace.

   Fast with my spell, celestial God, I hold thee. Homage to thee!
   Thy home is in the heavens.
 [0200202]Sky-reaching, like the Sun in brightness, holy, he who averts
    from us the Gods' displeasure.
   Lord of the World, may the Gandharva bless us, the friendly
   God who only must be worshipped.
 [0200203]I came, I met these faultless, blameless beings: among the
   Apsarases was the Gandharva.
   Their home is in the sea--so men have told me,--whence they
    come quickly hitherward and vanish.
 [0200204]Thou, Cloudy! ye who follow the Gandharva Visva-vasu, ye,
   Starry! Lightning-Flasher!
   You, O ye Goddesses, I truly worship.
 [0200205]Haunters of darkness, shrill in voice, dice-lovers, maddeners of
    the mind
   To these have I paid homage, the Gandharva's wives, Apsarases.

    medicine.
 [0200302]Hither and onward! Well! Come on! Among thy hundred
    remedies
   Most excellent of all art thou, curing disease and morbid flow.
 [0200303]The Asuras bury deep in earth this mighty thing that healeth
    wounds.
   This is the cure for morbid flow, this driveth malady away.
 [0200304]The emmets from the water-flood produce this healing medicine:
   This is the cure for morbid flow, this driveth malady away.
 [0200305]Mighty is this wound-healing balm: from out the earth was it
    produced.
   This is the cure for morbid flow, this driveth malady away.

    pain.
 [0200403]This overcomes Vishkandha, this chases the greedy fiends away:
   May this our panacea, may Jangida save us from distress.
 [0200404]With Jangida that brings delight, Amulet given by the Gods,
   We in the conflict overcome Vishkandha and all Rakshasas.
 [0200405]May Cannabis and Jangida preserve me from Vishkandha,--
    that
   Brought to us from the forest, this sprung from the saps of
    husbandry.
 [0200406]This Amulet destroys the might of magic and malignity:
   So may victorious Jangida prolong the years we have to live.

HYMN V

  

Invitation to, and praise of Indra

[0200501]Indra, be gracious, drive thou forth, come, Hero, with thy two
    bay steeds.
   Taste the libation, hither, enjoying meath and the hymn, come,
    fair, to the banquet.
 [0200502]O Indra, even as one athirst, fill thee with meath as 'twere from
    heaven.
   Sweet-toned, the raptures of this juice have come to thee as to
    the light.
 [0200503]Swift-conquering Indra, Mitra like, smote, as a Yati, Vritra
    dead.
   Like Bhrigu he cleft Vala through, and quelled his foes in Soma's
    rapturous joy.
 [0200504]O Indra, let the juices enter thee. Fill full thy belly, sate thee,
    mighty one! Let the hymn bring thee.
   Hear thou my call, accept the song I sing, here, Indra, with thy
    friends enjoy thyself, to height of rapture.
 [0200505]Now will I tell the manly deeds of Indra, the first that he
    achieved, the thunder-wielder.
   He slew the Dragon, then disclosed the waters, and cleft the
    channels of the mountain torrents.
 [0200506]He slew the Dragon lying on the mountain: his heavenly bolt of
    thunder Tvashtar fashioned.
   Like lowing kine in rapid flow descending the waters glided
    downward to the ocean.
 [0200507]Impetuous as a bull he chose the Soma, and quaffed the juices
    in three sacred beakers. [p. a38]
   Maghavan grasped the thunder for his weapon, and smote to
    death this first-born of the dragons.

   Flash forth with thy celestial effulgence: illumine all four regions
    of the heavens.
 [0200602]Kindle thee, Agni, and make this man prosper: rise up erect
    for high and happy fortune.
   Agni, be those uninjured who adore thee, and may thy priests be
    glorious and no others.
 [0200603]These Brahmans have elected thee, O Agni: be thou propitious
    in our sacred chamber.
   Slayer of rivals, Agni, quell our foemen: watch in our house
    with care that never ceases.
 [0200604]Seize, Agni, on thy power and firmly hold it: contend thou with
    the Friend by way of friendship.
   Placed in the centre of our fellows, Agni, flash forth to be
    invoked by kings around thee.
 [0200605]Past those who slay, past enemies, past thoughtless men, past
    those who hate,
   Yea, Agni, hear us safe past all distresses: give thou us opulence
    with men about us.

   Hath washed from me all curses, as water makes clean from
    spot and stain.
 [0200702]All curses of a rival, each curse of a female relative, Curse
    uttered by an augry priest, all these we tread beneath our feet.
 [0200703]Spread on the surface of the earth, downward from heaven thy
    root depends: [p. a40]
   With this that hath a thousand joints keep thou us safe on every
    side.
 [0200704]Guard on all sides this woman, guard my children, us, and all
    our wealth!
   Let not malignity o'ercome, nor adversaries conquer us.
 [0200705]Upon the curser fall his curse! Dwell we with him whose heart
    is true!
   We split the cruel villain's ribs whose evil eye bewitches us.

 [0200802]Vanish this Night, extinct in Dawn! Let those who weave their
    spells depart.

 [0200803]With straw of barley tawny-brown in colour with its silvery ears,
    with stalk and stem of Sesamum-

    and act! To the Field's Lord be homage paid.

   And raise him up again, O Tree, into the world of living men.
 [0200902]He hath arisen and come once more, rejoined the band of those
    who live.
   May he become the sire of sons, and of all men most fortunate.
 [0200903]He hath returned to consciousness, rejoined the living's firm
    abodes,
   For hundred leeches are in this, yea, and a thousand healing
    herbs.
 [0200904]The Gods, the Brahman-priests, and plants observed the way to
    gather thee:
   All deities described the way men gather thee upon the earth.

   Pure, with a leech he verily shall give thee medicines that heal.

A prayer for vengeance on a malicious rival worshipper

[0201201]The spacious Firmament, and Earth and Heaven, the Field's
   Queen, and the wonderful Wide-Strider,
   Yea, the broad middle air which Vata guardeth, may these now
    burn with heat while I am burning.
 [0201202]Listen to this, ye Gods who merit worship. Hymns here are sung
    for me by Bharadvaja.
   Bound in the noose may he be doomed to trouble whoever mars
    this that our mind hath purposed.
 [0201203]Hear this my call, O Indra, Soma-drinker, as with a burning
    heart I oft invoke thee.
   I smite, as 'twere a tree felled with a hatchet, the man who
    marreth this my plan and purpose.
 [0201204]Together with thrice-eighty Sama-singers, Angirases, and Vasus,
    and Adityas,
   May the felicity of the Fathers guard us. I seize that man with
    fire that Gods have kindled. [p. a45]
 [0201205]O Heaven and Earth, regard me with your favour, and, all ye
   Gods, stand on my side and help me.
   Angirases, Fathers worthy of the Soma! woe fall on him who,
    caused the hateful outrage!
 [0201206]Whoever either scorns us, O ye Maruts, or blames devotion
    which we now are paying.
   Let his own wicked deeds be fires to burn him. May Heaven
    consume the man who hates devotion.
 [0201207]Thy sevenfold vital breath, thine eight marrows I rend away
    with prayer.
   With Agni as thine envoy, go, prepared, to Yama's dwelling
    place.
 [0201208]In Jatavedas kindled flame I set the place assigned to thee.
   Let fire consume thy body, and thy voice go to the general
    breath.

    life, and death when age removes him.
   The garment hath Brihaspati presented to Soma, to the King, to
    w rap about him.
 [0201303]Thou for our w eal hast clothed thee in the mantle: thou hast
    become our heifers' guard from witchcraft.
   Live thou a hundred full and plenteous autumns, and wrap thee
    in prosperity of riches.
 [0201304]Come hither, stand upon the stone: thy body shall become a
    stone.
   The Universal Gods shall make thy life a hundred autumns

   So after thee, well-formed and growing stronger, be born a
    multitude of thriving brothers.

    weak at the meeting,
   Whatever sin the captive hath committed, do thou for weal
    release him, Visvakarman!
 [0203504]Awful are Rishis: unto them be homage, and to their eye and

   Great powers and glories are contained within her: a first-born
    bride, she conquers and bears children.

    annual oblation ready.
   First Ashtaka! may we be lords of riches, with goodly children
    and good men about us.
 [0301006]The shrine of Ila flows with oil and fatness: accept, O Jatavedas,

   Years.
   Dhatar, Vidhatar, Fortune, to the lord of all existing things.
 [0301011]With fatness and libation we sacrifice and adore the Gods.
   Wealthy in kine may we retire to rest us in our modest homes.
 [0301012]Ekashtaka, burning with zealous fervour, brought forth her
    babe the great and glorious Indra.
   With him the Gods subdued their adversaries: the Lord of
   Might became the Dasyus' slayer.

   Let kindly old age lead thee on. Let all the other deaths, whereof
    men count a hundred, pass away!

 [0301502]The many paths which Gods are wont to travel, the paths which
    go between the earth and heaven,
   May they rejoice with me in milk and fatness that I may make
    rich profit by my purchase.
 [0301503]With fuel. Agni! and with butter, longing, mine offering I
    present for strength and conquest;
   With prayer, so far as I have strength, adoring--this holy hymn
    to gain a hundred treasures.
 [0301504]Pardon this stubbornness of ours. O Agni, the distant pathway
    which our feet have trodden.
   Propitious unto us be sale and barter, may interchange of mer-
    chandise enrich me.
   Accept, ye twain, accordant, this libation! Prosperous be our
    ventures and incomings.
 [0301505]The wealth wherewith I carry on my traffic, seeking, ye Gods!
    wealth with the wealth I offer,
   May this grow more for me, not less: O Agni, through sacrifice
    chase those who hinder profit!
 [0301506]The wealth wherewith I carry on my traffic, seeking, ye Gods!
    wealth with the wealth I offer,
   Herein may Indra, Savitar, and Soma, Prajapati, and Agni give
    me splendour.
 [0301507]With reverence we sign thy praise, O Hotar-priest Vaisvanara.
   Over our children keep thou watch, over our bodies, kine, and
    lives.
 [0301508]Still to thee ever will we bring oblation, as to a stabled horse, O
   Jatavedas.
   Joying in food and in the growth of riches may we thy servants,
   Agni, never suffer.

A Rishi's morning prayer

[0301601]Agni at dawn, and Indra we invoke at dawn, and Varuna and
   Mitra, and the Asvins twain:
   Bhaga at dawn, Pushan and Brahmanaspati, Soma at dawn, and
   Rudra we invoke at dawn.

   Gods' protecting favour. [p. a85]
 [0301605]May Bhaga verily be bliss-bestower, and through him, Gods!
    may happiness attend us.
   As such with all my might I call and call thee: as such be thou
    our leader here, O Bhaga.
 [0301606]To this our sacrifice may the Dawns incline them, and come to
    the pure place like Dadhikravan.
   As strong steeds draw a chariot may they bring me hitherward
   Bhaga who discovers treasure.
 [0301607]May the kind Mornings dawn on us for ever with, wealth of
    kine, of horses, and of heroes.
   Streaming with all abundance, pouring fatness,
   Do ye preserve us evermore with blessings!

    her.
   May she, well stored with milk yield milk for us through each
    succeeding year.
 [0301705]Happily let the shares turn up the ploughland, the ploughers
    happily follow the oxen.
   Pleased with our sacrifice, Suna and Sira! make the plants bring
    this man abundant produce.
 [0301706]Happily work our steers and men! May the plough furrow
    happily,
   Happily be the traces bound. Happily ply the driving-goad.
 [0301707]Suna and Sira, welcome ye this laud, and with the milk that ye
    have made in heaven,
   Bedew ye both this earth of ours.
 [0301708]Auspicious Sita, come thou near: we venerate and worship thee.
   That thou mayst bless and prosper us and bring us fruits
    abundantly.
 [0301709]Loved by the Visvedevas and the Maruts, let Sita be bedewed.

On the means to obtain immunity from taxation in the next world

[0302901]When yonder kings who sit beside Yama divide among them-
    selves the sixteenth part of hopes fulfilled,
   A ram bestowed as sacrifice, white-footed, frees us from the tax.
 [0302902]He satisfies each hope and want, prevailing, present and pre-

    holds.
   Ascends to the celestial height, the heaven where tribute is not
    paid to one more mighty by the weak.
 [0302904]He who bestows a white-hooved ram, adequate to the place he

   Come, speaking sweetly each one to the other. I make you one-
    intentioned and one-minded. [p. a102]
 [0303006]Let what you drink, your share of food be common together,
    with one common bond I bid you.
   Serve Agni, gathered round him like the spokes about the
    chariot nave.
 [0303007]With binding charm I make you all united, obeying one sole
    leader and one-minded.
   Even as the Gods who watch and guard the Amrit, at morn and
    eve may ye be kindly-hearted.

    plants!

HYMN I

  

Cosmogonical and mystico-theological doctrine

[0400101]Eastward at first the prayer was generated: Vena disclosed bright
    flashes from the summit,
   Disclosed his deepest, nearest revelations, womb of the non-
    existent and existent.
 [0400102]Let this Queen come in front, her Father's daughter, found in
    the worlds for earliest generation.
   For him they set this radiant vault in motion. Let them prepare
    warm milk for him who first would drink.
 [0400103]He who was born as his all-knowing kinsman declareth all the
    deities' generations.
   He from the midst of prayer his prayer hath taken. On high,
    below, spread forth his godlike nature.
 [0400104]For he, true to the law of Earth and Heaven, established both
    the mighty worlds securely.
   Mighty when born, he propped apart the mighty, the sky, our
    earthly home, and air's mid-region.
 [0400105]He from the depth hath been reborn for ever, Brihaspati the
    world's sole Lord and Ruler.
   From light was born the Day with all its lustre: through this
    let sages live endowed with splendour.
 [0400106]The sage and poet verily advanceth the statute of that mighty
   God primeval.
   He was born here with many more beside him: they slumbered
    when the foremost side was opened.
 [0400107]The man who seeks the friend of Gods, Atharvan the father,
    and Brihaspati, with worship,
   Crying to him, Be thou all things' creator! the wise God, self-
    dependent, never injures.

[0400301]Three have gone hence and passed away, the man, the tiger,

   Down, verily, the rivers flow, down-goeth the celestial Tree,.
    down let our foemen bend and bow.
 [0400302]On distant pathway go the wolf, on pathway most remote the
    thief!
   On a far road speed forth the rope with teeth, and the malicious
    man!
 [0400303]We crush and rend to pieces both thine eyes, O Tiger, and thy
    jaws and all the twenty claws we break.
 [0400304]We break and rend the tiger first of creatures that are armed.
    with teeth;
   The robber then, and then the snake, the sorcerer, and then the
    wolf.
 [0400305]The thief who cometh near to-day departeth bruised and crush-
    ed to bits.
   By nearest way let him be gone. Let Indra slay him with his
    bolt.
 [0400306]Let the beast's teeth be broken off, shivered and shattered be
    his ribs! [p. a108]
   Slack be thy bowstring: downward go the wild beast that
    pursues the hare!
 [0400307]Open not what thou hast compressed, close not what thou hast
    not compressed.
   Indra's and Soma's child, thou art Atharvan's tiger-crushing
    charm.

[0400401]We dig thee from the earth, the Plant which strengthens and

   The Plant which the Gandharva dug for Varuna whose power
    was lost.
 [0400402]Let Ushas and let Surya rise, let this the speech I utter rise.

A lover's sleep-charm

[0400501]The Bull who hath a thousand horns, who rises up from out the
    sea,
   By him the strong and mighty one we lull the folk to rest and.
    sleep.
 [0400502]Over the surface of the earth there breathes no wind, there looks.
    no eye.
   Lull all the women, lull the dogs to sleep, with Indra as thy
    friend!
 [0400503]The woman sleeping in the court, lying without, or stretched on
    beds,
   The matrons with their odorous sweets--these, one and all, we
    lull to sleep.
 [0400504]Each moving thing have I secured, have held and held the eye
    and breath.
   Each limb and member have I seized in the deep darkness of
    the night.
 [0400505]The man who sits, the man who walks, whoever stands and clearly
    sees
   Of these we closely shut the eyes, even as we closely shut this
    house.
 [0400506]Sleep mother, let the father sleep, sleep dog, and master of the
    home.
   Let all her kinsmen sleep, sleep all the people who are round
    about.
 [0400507]With soporific charm, O Sleep, lull thou to slumber all the folk.
   Let the rest sleep till break of day, I will remain awake till

HYMN VI

  

A charm to make a poisoned arrow harmless

[0400601]The Brahman first was brought to life ten-headed and with faces
    ten.
   First drinker of the Soma, he made poison ineffectual.
 [0400602]Far as the heavens and earth are spread in compass, far as the
   Seven Rivers are extended,
   So far my spell, the antidote of poison, have I spoken hence,
 [0400603]The strong-winged Bird Garutman first of all, O Poison fed on
    thee:
   Thou didst not gripe or make him drunk: aye, thou becamest
    food for him.
 [0400604]Whoever with five fingers hath discharged thee from the crooked
    bow,
   I from the shaft have charmed away the poison of the fastening
    band.
 [0400605]The poison have I charmed away from shaft, cement, and feather-
    ed end;
   Yea, from the barb, the neck, the horn, the poison have I charmed
    away.
 [0400606]Feeble, O Arrow, is thy shaft, thy poison, too, hath lost its
    strength.
   Made of a worthless tree, thy bow, O feeble one, is impotent.
 [0400607]The men who brayed it, smeared it on, they who discharged it,
    sent it forth,
   All these are made emasculate, emasculate the poison-hill.
 [0400608]Thy diggers are emasculate, emasculate, O, Plant art thou.
   The rugged mountain that produced this poison is emasculate.

HYMN VII

  

A charm to make a poisonous plant innocuous

[0400701]So may this water guard us on the bank of Varanavati.
   Therein hath Amrit been infused: with that I ward thy poison
    off.
 [0400702]Weak is the poison of the East, weak is the poison of the North,
   So too this poison of the South counts as a cake of curds and
    meal.
 [0400703]When he hath made of thee a cake, broad, steaming, swelling up
    with fat,
   And even in hunger eaten thee, then gripe him not, thou hideous
    one!
 [0400704]Intoxicater! like a shaft we make thy spirit fly away, Like a pot
    boiling on the fire, we with our word remove thee hence.
 [0400705]We set around thee with the spell as 'twere a gathered arma-
    ment.
   Stay quiet like a rooted tree. Dug up with mattocks, gripe not
    thou.
 [0400706]For coverings men have bartered thee, for skins of deer and
    woven cloths.
   Thou art a thing of sale, O Plant. Dug up with mattocks, gripe
    not thou!
 [0400707]None have attained to those of old, those who wrought holy acts
    for you.
   Let them not harm our heroes here. Therefore I set before you
    this.

HYMN VIII

  

A benediction at the consecration of a King

[0400801]The Being lays the sap of life in beings: he hath become the
    sovran Lord of creatures.
   Death comes to this man's royal consecration: let him as King
    own and allow this kingdom.
 [0400802]Come forward, turn not back in scorn, strong guardian, slayer
    of the foes.
   Approach, O gladdener of thy friends. The Gods have blessed
    and strengthened thee.
 [0400803]All waited on him as he came to meet them. He self-resplendent
    moves endued with glory.
   That is the royal hero's lofty nature: he, manifold, hath gained
    immortal powers.
 [0400804]Stride forth to heaven's broad regions, thou, a tiger on a tiger's
    skin.
   Let all the people long for thee. Let heavenly floods be rich in
    milk.
 [0400805]Heaven's waters joyous in their milk, the waters of middle air,
    and those that earth containeth-
   I with the gathered power and might of all these waters sprinkle
    thee,
 [0400806]The heavenly waters rich in milk have sprinkled thee with power
    and might.
   To be the gladdener of thy friends. May Savitar so fashion thee.
 [0400807]These, compassing the tiger, rouse the lion to great joy and
    bliss. [p. a113]

A charm addressed to a precious ointment for safety and wealth

[0400901]Approach! thou art the mountain's eye, the living thing that
    saveth us;
   A gift bestowed by all the Gods, yea, the defence that guardeth
    life.
 [0400902]Thou art the safeguard of the men, thou art the safeguard of
    the kine,
   Thou standest ready to protect the horses that are fleet of foot.
 [0400903]Thou, also, Salve! art a defence that rends and crushes
    sorcerers.
   Thou knowest, too, of Amrit, thou art the delight of all who
    live, a jaundice-curing balm art thou.
 [0400904]Whomso thou creepest over, Salve! member by member, joint
    by joint,
   From him, like some strong arbiter of strife, thou banishest
    decline.
 [0400905]No imprecation reaches him, no magic, no tormenting fiend,
   O Salve, Vishkandha seizes not the man who carries thee about.
 [0400906]From lying speech, from evil dream, from wicked act and
    sinfulness, [p. a114]
   From hostile and malignant eye,--from these, O Salve, protect
    us well.
 [0400907]I, knowing this, O Salve, will speak the very truth and not a
    lie:
   May I obtain both horse and ox, may I obtain thy life, O man.
 [0400908]Three are the slaves that serve the Salve, Fever, Consumption,
    and the Snake.
   Thy father is the loftiest of mountains, named the Triple-
    peaked.
 [0400909]Sprung from the Snowy Mountain's side, this Ointment of the
   Three-peaked hill.
   Crushes and rends all sorcerers and every witch and sorceress.
 [0400910]If thou art from the Three-peaked hill or hast thy name from
   Yamuna,
   These names are both auspicious: by these two protect thou us,
   O Salve!

HYMN X

  

A charm accompanying investiture with an amulet of shell

[0401001]Child of the wind firmament, sprung from the lightning and the
    light,
   May this the gold-born Shell that bears the pearl preserve us
    from distress.
 [0401002]Shell that wast born from out the sea, set at the head of
    things that shine!
   With thee we slay the Rakshasas and overcome voracious fiends.
 [0401003]We stay disease and indigence, and chase Sadanvas with the
   Shell.
   May the all-healing Shell that bears the pearl preserve us from
    distress.
 [0401004]Born in the heaven, sprung from the sea, brought to us hither
    from the flood.
   This gold-born Shell shall be to us an amulet to lengthen life.
 [0401005]From ocean sprang the Amulet, from Vritra sprang the Lord of
   Day:
   May this protect us round about from shaft of God and Asura.
 [0401006]Peerless 'mid golden ornaments art thou: from Soma wast thou
    born.
   Thou gleamest on the quiver, thou art beautiful upon the car:
    may it prolong our days of life!
 [0401007]Bone of the Good became the pearl's shell-mother endowed with
    soul it moveth in the waters.
   I bind this on thee for life, strength, and vigour, for long life
    lasting through a hundred autumns.
   May the pearl's mother keep and guard thee safely!

HYMN XI

  

A glorification of the sacrificial gharma or milk caldron

[0401101]The Bull supports the wide-spread earth and heaven, the Bull
    supports the spacious air between them.
   The Bull supports the sky's six spacious regions: the universal
    world hath he pervaded.
 [0401102]The Bull is Indra o'er the beasts he watches. He, Sakra
    measures out three several pathways.
   He, milking out the worlds, the past, the future, discharges all
    the Gods' eternal duties.
 [0401103]Being produced among mankind as Indra, the Caldron works
    heated and brightly glowing.
   Let him not, with good sons, pass off in vapour who hath not
    eaten of the Ox with knowledge.
 [0401104]The Ox pours milk out in the world of virtue: in earliest time,
    he, Pavam5na, swells it.
   Parjanya is the stream, Maruts his udder, sacrifice is the milk,
    the meed his milking.
 [0401105]That which not sacrifice nor sacrificer, not giver nor receiver
    rules and governs,
   All-winning, all-supporting, all-effecting,--which of all quadru-
    peds, tell us! is the Caldron?
 [0401106]May we, fame-seekers, reach the world of virtue by service of
    the Gharma and through fervour,
   Whereby the Gods went up to heaven, the centre of life eternal,
    having left the body.
 [0401107]Prajapati, supreme and sovran ruler, Indra by form and by his
    shoulder Agni,
   Came to Visvanara, came to all men's Bullock: he firmly forti-
    fied and held securely. [p. a117]
 [0401108]The middle of the Bullock's neck, there where the shoulder-bar
    is placed,
   Extends as far to east of him as that is settled to the west.
 [0401109]He whosoever knows the seven exhaustless pourings of the Ox,
   Wins himself offspring and the world: the great Seven Rishis
    know this well.
 [0401110]With feet subduing weariness, with legs extracting freshening
    draughts,
   Through toil the plougher and the Ox approach the honeyed
    beverage.
 [0401111]Assigned are these twelve nights, they say, as holy to Prajapati:
   Whoever knows their proper prayer performs the service of the
   Ox.
 [0401112]At evening he is milked, is milked at early morn, is milked at
    noon.
   We know that streams of milk that flow from him are in-
    exhaustible.

A charm to mend a broken bone

[0401201]Thou art the healer, making whole, the healer of the broken
    bone:
   Make thou this whole, Arundhati!
 [0401202]Whatever bone of thine within thy body hath been wrenched or
    cracked,
   May Dhatar set it properly and join together limb by limb.
 [0401203]With marrow be the marrow joined, thy limb united with the
    limb.
   Let what hath fallen of thy flesh, and the bone also grow again.
 [0401204]Let marrow close with marrow, let skin grow united with the
    skin.
   Let blood and bone grow strong in thee, flesh grow together
    with the flesh.
 [0401205]Join thou together hair with hair, join thou together skin with
    skin.
   Let blood and bone grow strong in thee. Unite the broken part,.
   O Plant.
 [0401206]Arise, advance, speed forth; the car hath goodly fellies, naves,
    and wheels!!
   Stand up erect upon thy feet.
 [0401207]If he be torn and shattered, having fallen into a pit, or a cast
    stone have struck him,
   Let the skilled leech join limb with limb, as 'twere the portions
    of a car.

A charm to restore a sick man to health

[0401301]Gods, raise again the man whom ye, O Gods, have humbled
    and brought low.
   Ye Gods, restore to life again, him, Gods! who hath committed
    sin.
 [0401302]Here these two winds are blowing far as Sindhu from a distant
    land.
   May one breathe energy to thee, the other blow thy fault away.
 [0401303]Hither, O Wind, blow healing balm, blow every fault away, thou
   Wind!
   For thou who hast all medicine comest as envoy of the Gods.
 [0401304]May the Gods keep and save this man, the Maruts' host deliver
    him.
   All things that be deliver him that he be freed from his offence.
 [0401305]I am come nigh to thee with balms to give thee rest and keep
    thee safe.
   I bring thee mighty strength, I drive thy wasting malady away.
 [0401306]Felicitous is this my hand, yet more felicitous is this.
   This hand contains all healing balms, and this makes whole with
    gentle touch.
 [0401307]The tongue that leads the voice precedes. Then with our tenfold-
    branching hands.
   With these two healers of disease, we stroke thee with a soft
    caress.

HYMN XIV

  

Accompanying the sacrifice of a he-goat

[0401401]The Goat was verily produced from Agni. Through sorrow he
    beheld, at first, his father.
   Through him at first the Gods attained to godhead, and, meet
    for sacrifices, were exalted.
 [0401402]Bearing in hands seethed viands, go with Agni to the cope of
    heaven.
   Reaching the sky that touches heaven, mix with the company of
   Gods.
 [0401403]From earth's high ridge to middle air I mounted, and from mid-
    air ascended up to heaven.
   From the high pitch of heaven's cope I came into the world of
    light.
 [0401404]Mounting the sky they look not round; they rise to heaven
    through both the worlds,
   Sages who paid the sacrifice that pours its streams on every
    side.
 [0401405]First among all the deities, come forward, thou who art eye of
   Gods and men, O Agni.
   Imploring, and accordant with the Bhrigus, to heaven in safety
    go the sacrificers!
 [0401406]With milk and butter I anoint the mighty, celestial Goat, strong-
    winged, and full of juices.
   Through him will we attain the world of virtue, ascending to the
    loftiest cope, to heaven.
 [0401407]Set the Goat's head toward the eastern region, and turn his right
    side to the southern quarter.
   His hinder part turn to the western quarter, and set his left side
    to the northern region.
 [0401408]Set the Goat's backbone upmost in the zenith, and lay his belly
    downward in the nadir; set his midportion in mid-air between
    them.
 [0401409]O'er the dressed Goat lay a dressed skin to robe him prepared,
    in perfect form, with all his members.
   Rise upward to the loftiest vault of heaven: with thy four feet
    stand firmly in the regions.

HYMN XV

  

A charm to hasten the coming of the rains

[0401501]Let all the misty regions fly together, let all the rain-clouds sped
    by wind, assemble.
   Let waters satisfy the earth, the voices of the great mist-enve-
    loped Bull who roareth.
 [0401502]Let them show forth, the strong, the bounteous Maruts: let
    plants and shrubs be hung with drops of moisture.
   Let floods of rain refresh the ground with gladness and herbs
    spring various with each form and colour.
 [0401503]Cause us who sing to see the gathering vapours: out burst in
    many a place the rush of waters!
   Let floods of rain refresh the ground with gladness; and herbs
    spring various with each form and colour.
 [0401504]Apart, Parjanya! let the troops of Maruts, roaring, swell the
    song.
   Let pouring torrents of the rain that raineth rain upon the
    earth.
 [0401500]5. Up from the sea lift your dread might, ye Maruts: as light and
    splendour, send the vapour upward! [p. a122]
   Let waters satisfy the earth, the voices of the great mist-enve-
    loped Bull who roareth.
 [0401506]Roar, thunder, set the sea in agitation, bedew the ground with
    thy sweet rain, Parjanya!
   Send plenteous showers on him who seeketh shelter, and let the
    owner of lean kine go homeward.
 [0401507]Let the boon Maruts, let the springs and coiling serpents tend!
    you well.
   Urged by the Maruts let the clouds pour down their rain upon.
    the earth.
 [0401508]Let lightning flash on every side: from all the regions blow the
    winds!
   Urged by the Maruts let the clouds pour down their rain upon
    the earth.
 [0401509]May waters, lightning, cloud, and rain, boon springs and serpents
    tend you well.
   Urged by the Maruts let the clouds pour down their rain upon
    the earth.
 [0401510]May he who hath become the plants' high regent, suiting our
    bodies, Agni of the Waters,
   May Jatavedas send us rain from heaven, Amrit and vital breath
    to earthly creatures.
 [0401511]Sending up waters from the flood and ocean Prajapati move the
    sea to agitation!
   Forth flow the moisture of the vigorous stallion!
   With this thy roar of thunder come thou hither,
 [0401512]Our father, Lord divine pouring the torrents. Let the streams
    breathe, O Varuna, of the waters.
   Pour the floods down: along the brooks and channels let frogs
    with speckled arms send out their voices.
 [0401513]They who lay quiet for a year, the Brahmans who fulfil their
    vows.
   The frogs, have lifted up their voice, the voice Parjanya hath.
    inspired.
 [0401514]Speak forth a welcome, female frog! Do thou O frog, accost
    the rain.
   Stretch thy four feet apart, and swim in the middle of the lake.
 [0401515]Khanvakha, ho! Khaimakha, ho! thou in the middle, Taduri!
   Fathers, enjoy the rain from one who strives to win the Marutes
    heart.[p. a123]
 [0401516]Lift up the mighty cask and pour down water; let the wind
    blow, and lightnings flash around us.
   Let sacrifice be paid, and, widely scattered, let herbs and plants
    be full of joy and gladness.

HYMN XVI

  

On the omnipresence and omniscience of Varuna

[0401601]The mighty Ruler of these worlds beholds as though from close
    at hand,
   The man who thinks he acts by stealth: all this the Gods
    perceive and know.
 [0401602]If a man stands or walks or moves in secret, goes to his lying-
    down or his uprising,
   What two men whisper as they sit together, King Varuna knows:
    he as the third is present.
 [0401603]This earth, too, is King Varuna's possession, and the high
    heaven whose ends are far asunder.
   The loins of Varuna are both the oceans, and this small drop of
    water, too, contains him. [p. a124]
 [0401604]If one should flee afar beyond the heaven, King Varuna would
    still be round about him.
   Proceeding hither from the sky his envoys look, thousand-eyed,
    over the earth beneath them.
 [0401605]All this the royal Varuna beholdeth, all between heaven and
    earth and all beyond them.
   The twinklings of men's eyelids hath he counted. As one who
    plays throws dice he settles all things.
 [0401606]Those fatal snares of thine which stand extended, threefold,
   O Varuna, seven by seven,
   May they all catch the man who tells a falsehood, and pass un-
    harmed the man whose words are truthful.
 [0401607]Varuna, snare him with a hundred nooses! Man's watcher! let
    not him who lies escape thee.
   There let the villain sit with hanging belly and bandaged like a
    cask whose hoops are broken.
 [0401608]Varuna sends, and drives away, diseases: Varuna is both native
    and a stranger,
   Varuna is celestial and is human.
 [0401609]I bind and hold thee fast with all these nooses, thou son of such
    a man and such a mother.
   All these do I assign thee as thy portion.

HYMN XVII

  

A charm to secure freedom from various evils

[0401701]We seize and hold thee, Conquering One! the queen of medi-
    cines that heal.
   O Plant, I have endowed thee with a hundred powers for every
    man,
 [0401702]Still conquering, banishing the curse, mighty, with thy reverted.
    bloom.
   Thee and all Plants have I invoked: Hence let it save us! was
    my prayer.
 [0401703]She who hath cursed us with a curse, or hath conceived a
    murderous sin,
   Or seized our son to take his blood, may she devour the child
    she bare.
 [0401704]What magic they have wrought for thee in dish unbaked or
    burnt dark-red,
   What they have wrought in flesh undressed,--conquer the
    sorcerers therewith.
 [0401705]Ill dream and wretchedness of life, Rakshasa, monster, stingy
    hags,
   All the she-fiends of evil name and voice, we drive away from
    us.
 [0401706]Death caused by famine, caused by thirst, failure of children,.
    loss of kine,
   With thee, O Apamarga, all this ill we cleanse and wipe away.
 [0401707]Death caused by thirst, death caused by stress of hunger, loss at
    play with dice,
   All this, O Apamarga with thine aid we cleanse and wipe away.
 [0401708]The Apamarga is alone the sovran of all Plants that grow.
   With this we wipe away whate'er hath fallen on thee: go in
    health!

HYMN XVIII

  

A counter-charm against the incantations of enemies

[0401801]The moonlight equalleth the sun, night is the rival of the day.
   I make effectual power my help: let magic arts be impotent.
 [0401802]Gods! if one make and bring a spell on some man's house who
    knows it not,
   Close as the calf that sucks the cow may it revert and cling to
    him.
 [0401803]When one puts poison in a dish of unbaked clay to kill a man,
   It cracks when set upon the fire with the sharp sound of many
    stones.
 [0401804]Endowed with thousand powers! adjure the bald and those with
    necks awry.
   Back to its author turn the spell like a dear damsel to her
    friend!
 [0401805]I with this Plant have ruined all malignant powers of witchery.
   The spell which they have laid upon thy field, thy cattle, or thy
    men.
 [0401806]No power had he who wrought the spell: he hurt his foot, he
    broke his toe.
   His act hath brought us happiness and pain and sorrow to him-
    self.
 [0401807]Let Apamarga sweep away chronic disease and every curse,
   Sweep sorceresses clean away, and all malignant stingy hags.
 [0401808]Sweep thou away the sorcerers, all stingy fiendish hags away.
   All this, O Apamarga, with thine aid we wipe away from us.

HYMN XIX

  

A counter-charm and charm to secure general protection.

[0401901]Thou breakest ties of kith and kin, thou causest, too, relation-
    ship:
   So bruise the sorcerer's offspring, like a reed that groweth in the
   Rains.
 [0401902]Thou hast been blessed with blessing by the Brahman, Kanva
   Narshada.
   Thou fliest like a flashing dart: there is no fear or danger, Plant!
    within the limit of thy range.
 [0401903]Illumining, as 'twere, with light, thou movest at the head of
    plants.
   The saviour of the simple man art thou, and slayer of the fiends.
 [0401904]As once when time began the Gods with thee expelled the
   Asuras,
   Even thence, O Plant, wast thou produced as one who wipes and
    sweeps away.
 [0401905]Thy father's name was Cleaver. Thou with thousand branches
    cleavest all.
   Do thou, turned backward, cleave and rend the man who treateth
    us as foes.
 [0401906]The evil sprang from earth; it mounts to heaven and spreads to
    vast extent.
   Reverted, shaking him with might, thence on its maker let it
    fall.
 [0401907]For thou hast grown reverted, and turned backward also is thy
    fruit.
   Remove all curses far from me, keep most remote the stroke of
    death. [p. a128]
 [0401908]Preserve me with a hundred, yea, protect me with a thousand
    aids.
   May mighty Indra, Lord of Plants! give store of strength and.
    power to thee.

HYMN XX

  

A charm for the acquisition of superhuman powers of sight

[0402001]It sees in front, it sees behind, it sees afar away, it sees
   The sky, the firmament, and earth: all this, O Goddess, it
    beholds.
 [0402002]Through thee, O godlike Plant, may I behold all creatures that
    exist,
   Three several heavens, three several earths, and these six regions
    one by one.
 [0402003]The pupil, verily, art thou of that celestial Engle's eye.
   On earth hast thou alighted as a weary woman seeks her couch.
 [0402004]The God who hath a thousand eyes give me this Plant in my
    right hand!
   I look on every one therewith, each Sudra and each Aryan man.
 [0402005]Make manifest the forms of things; hide not their essences from
    sight.
   And, thou who hast a thousand eyes, look the Kimidins in the
    face. [p. a129]
 [0402006]Make me see Yatudhanas, make thou Yatudhanis visible.
   Make me see all Pisachas With this prayer, O Plant, I hold thee
    fast.
 [0402007]Thou art the sight of Kasyapa and of the hound who hath four
    eyes.
   Make the Pisacha manifest as Surya when he rides at noon.
 [0402008]Kimidin, Yatudhana from their hiding-places have I dragged.
   I look on every one with this, Sudra and Aryan man alike.
 [0402009]Make that Pisacha visible, the fiend who flies in middle air,
   The fiend who glides across the sky, and him who deems the
    earth his help.

HYMN XXI

  

Glorification and benediction of cows

[0402101]The kine have come and brought good fortune: let them rest in
    the cow-pen and be happy near us.
   Here let them stay prolific, many-coloured, and yield through
    many morns their milk for Indra.
 [0402102]Indra aids him who offers sacrifice and praise: he takes not what
    is his, and gives him more thereto.
   Increasing ever more and ever more his wealth, he makes the
    pious dwell within unbroken bounds.
 [0402103]These are ne'er lost, no robber ever injures them: no evil-minded
    foe attempts to harass them.
   The master of the kine lives a long life with these, the Cows
    whereby he pours his gifts and serves the Gods.
 [0402104]The charger with his dusty brow o'ertakes them not, and never
    to the shambles do they take their way.
   These Cows, the cattle of the pious worshipper, roam over wide-
    spread pasture where no danger is.
 [0402105]To me the Cows seem Bhaga, they seem Indra, they seem a
    portion of the first poured Soma.
   These present Cows, they, O ye men, are Indra. I long for Indra
    with my heart and spirit.
 [0402106]O Cows, ye fatten e'en the worn and wasted, and make the
    unlovely beautiful to look on.
   Prosper my home, ye with auspicious voices! Your power is
    magnified in our assemblies.
 [0402107]In goodly pasturage, bright-hued, prolific, drinking pure water at
    fair drinking-places,
   Never be thief or sinful man your master, and may the dart of
   Rudra still avoid you!

A benediction on a newly consecrated king

[0402201]Exalt and strengthen this my Prince, O Indra, Make him sole
    lord and leader of the people.
   Scatter his foes, deliver all his rivals into his hand in struggles
    for precedence.
 [0402202]Give him a share in village, kine, and horses, and leave his
    enemy without a portion.
   Let him as King be head and chief of Princes, Give up to him,
   O Indra, every foeman.
 [0402203]Let him be treasure-lord of goodly treasures, let him as King be
    master of the people.
   Grant unto him great power and might, O Indra, and strip his
    enemy of strength and vigour.
 [0402204]Like milch-kine yielding milk for warm libations, pour, Heaven
    and Earth! on him full many a blessing.
   May he as King be Indra's well-beloved, the darling of the kine,
    the plants, the cattle.
 [0402205]I join in league with thee victorious Indra, with whom men
    conquer and are ne'er defeated.
   He shall make thee the folk's sole lord and leader, shall make
    thee highest of all human rulers.
 [0402206]Supreme art thou, beneath thee are thy rivals, and all, O King,
    who were thine adversaries.
   Sole lord and leader and allied with Indra, bring, conqueror, thy
    foremen's goods and treasures.
 [0402207]Consume, with lion aspect, all their hamlets, with tiger aspect,
    drive away thy foemen.
   Sole lord and leader and allied with Indra, seize, conqueror,
    thine enemies' possessions.

Magnification of Agni and prayer for his protection

[0402301]I fix my heart on wise and ancient Agni, the Five Tribes' Lord,
    in many a place enkindled.
   We seek him who hath entered all our houses. May he deliver
    us from grief and trouble.
 [0402302]As thou conveyest offerings, Jatavedas! and fashionest the sacri-
    fice with knowledge,
   So bear thou to the Gods the prayer we utter. May he deliver
    us from grief and trouble.
 [0402303]I pray to Agni in each act successful, employed in every sacrifice,
    the strongest,
   Fiend-slayer, served with fatness, strengthening worship. May
    he deliver us from grief and trouble.
 [0402304]We invoke the oblation-bearer, well-born Agni Jatavedas,
   Him, Vaisvanara, almighty. May he set us free from trouble.
 [0402305]With whom as friend the Rishis gave their power new splendour,
    with whom they kept aloof the Asuras' devices,
   Agni, with whom Indra subdued the Panis. May he deliver us.
    from grief and trouble.
 [0402306]Through whom the Gods discovered life eternal, through whom
    they stored the plants with pleasant juices,
   Through whom they brought to men the light of heaven. May
    he deliver us from grief and trouble.
 [0402307]I, suppliant, praise and ever call on Agni, sole Lord of all this
    world, of all that shineth,
   Of what exists and shall exist hereafter. May he deliver us from
    grief and trouble.

    grief and trouble.
 [0402402]Who with strong arms o'ercame his strong opponents, who
    broke and crushed the power of the demons,
   Who won the rivers and the kine in battle. May he deliver us

 [0402403]Ruler of men, finder of light, the hero: the pressing-stones
    declare his valour, master.
   Of sweetest sacrifice with seven Hotars. May he deliver us from

 [0402404]The lord of barren cows and bulls and oxen, finder of light for
    whom the posts are planted,
   For whom the bright juice flows cleansed by devotion. May he

 [0402405]Whose favour those desire who offer Soma, whom, arrow-bearer,
    men invoke in battle,
   On whom the hymn depends, in whom is power, May he deliver
    us from grief and trouble.
 [0402406]Why was born, first, for active operation, whose valour as the
    first hath been awakened,
   Who raised his bolt when he encountered Ahi. May he deliver us
    from grief and trouble.
 [0402407]Strong Lord, who leadeth hosts to meet for battle, who sendeth
    riches both of earth and heaven,
   I, suppliant, praise and ever call on Indra. May he deliver us
    from grief and trouble.

   Ye who have come to be this All's pervaders, deliver us, ye two
    from grief and trouble.
 [0402502]Ye who have counted up the earth's expanses, and in the sky
    smoothed out the air's mid-region,
   Whose going-forth hath ne'er been reached by any, deliver us,
    ye two, from grief and trouble.
 [0402503]Beauteously bright! men rest in thy dominion when thou hast
    risen up and hastened onward.
   Ye, Vayu, Savitar, preserve all creatures. Deliver us, ye, twain,
    from grief and trouble.
 [0402504]Hence, Vayu, Savitar drive evil action, chase Simida away, drive
    off the demons.
   Ye give us store of energy and power. Deliver us, ye twain,
    from grief and trouble.
 [0402505]Of their own selves let Savitar and Vayu send favourable strength
    and wealth and plenty.
   Here give us perfect freedom from consumption. Deliver us, ye
    twain, from grief and trouble.
 [0402506]Ye, Savitar and Vayu, to assist us, enjoy the hymn and the
    delightful cheerer.
   Come hither downward from the stream of blessing. Deliver us,
    ye twain, from grief and trouble.
 [0402507]Like noblest benisons they have stayed in the God loving man's
    abode.
   I glorify bright Savitar and Vayu. Deliver us, ye twain, from
    grief and trouble.

   For ye are seats and homes of goodly treasures. Deliver us, ye

    have no strength or power,
   To me, O Heaven and Earth, be ye auspicious. Deliver us, ye
    twain, from grief and trouble.
 [0402607]The grief that pains me here, whoever caused it, not sent by fate,
    hath sprung from human action.
   I, suppliant, praise Heaven, Earth, and oft invoke them. Deliver
    us, ye twain, from grief and trouble.

   I call them like swift well-trained steeds to help us. May they
    deliver us from grief and trouble.

    plants, the speed of coursers
   To us may the strong Maruts be auspicious. May they deliver us
    from grief and trouble.
 [0402704]They who raised water from the sea to heaven and send it from

   Gods with their celestial power,
   Ye, kindly Gods, are able to restore it. May they deliver us from
    grief and trouble.
 [0402707]Potent in battles is the Maruts' army, impetuous train, well-
    known, exceeding mighty.
   I, suppliant, praise and oft invoke the Maruts. May they deliver
    us from grief and trouble.

    send your bolt of thunder.

    from grief and trouble.

A glorification of vak or speech

[0403001]I travel with the Rudras and the Vasus, with the Adityas and
   All-Gods I wander.
   I hold aloft both Varuna and Mitra, I hold aloft Indra and
    both the Asvins.
 [0403002]I am the Queen, the gatherer-up of treasures, most thoughtful,
    first of those who merit worship.
   The Gods, making me enter many places, in diverse spots have
    set mine habitation.
 [0403003]I, verily, myself announce and utter the word that Gods, and
    men alike shall welcome.
   I make the man I love exceeding mighty, make him a sage, a
   Rishi, and a Brahman.
 [0403004]Through me alone all eat the food that feeds them, each man
    who sees, breathes, hears, the word out-spoken.
   They know it not, but yet they dwell beside me. Hear, one and
    all, the truth as I declare it.
 [0403005]I bend the bow for Rudra that his arrow may strike and slay
    the hater of devotion.
   I rouse and order battle for the people, and I have penetrated
   Earth and Heaven.
 [0403006]I cherish and sustain high-swelling Soma, and Tvashtar I support,
   Pashan, and Bhaga.
   I load with wealth the zealous sacrificer who pours the juice and
    offers his oblation.
 [0403007]On the world's summit I bring forth the Father: my home is in
    the waters, in the ocean.
   Thence I extend o'er all existing creatures, and touch even
    yonder heaven with my forehead.
 [0403008]I breathe a strong breath like the wind and tempest, the while I
    hold together all existence. [p. a140]
   Beyond this wide earth and beyond the heavens I have become
    so mighty in my grandeur.

    arrows, sharpening their weapons.
 [0403102]Flashing like fire, be thou, O conquering Manyu, invoked, O

   Slay thou our foes, distribute their possession: show forth thy

 [0403103]O Manyu, overcome those who assail us. On! breaking, slaying,
    crushing down the foemen.
   They have not hindered thine impetuous vigour: mighty! sole
    born! reduce them to subjection.
 [0403104]Alone of many thou art worshipped, Manyu: sharpen the spirit
    of each clan for combat.
   With thee to aid, O thou of perfect splendour, we raise the
    glorious battle-shout for conquest.
 [0403105]Unyielding, bringing victory like Indra, O Manyu be thou here
    our sovran ruler. [p. a141]
   To thy dear name. O victor, we sing praises: we know the
    spring from which thou art come hither.
 [0403106]Twin-borne with power, destructive bolt of thunder the highest
    conquering might is thine, subduer!
   Be friendly to us in thy spirit, Manyu! O much-invoked, in
    shock of mighty battle!
 [0403107]For spoil let Varuna and Manyu give us the wealth of both sides
    gathered and collected;
   And let our enemies with stricken spirits, o'er-whelmed with.
    terror, sling away defeated.

    for himself forthwith all conquering energy.
   Arya and Dasa will we conquer with thine aid, with thee the
    conqueror, with conquest conquest-sped.
 [0403202]Manyu was Indra, yea, the God was Manyu; Manyu was Hotar
   Varuna, Jatavedas.
   The tribes of human lineage worship Manyu. Accordant, with
    thy fervour, Manyu! guard us.
 [0403203]Come hither, Manyu, mightier than the mighty: smite, with thy
    fervour, for ally, our foemen.
   Slayer of foes, of Vritra, and of Dasyu, bring thou to us all kinds
    of wealth and treasure.
 [0403204]For thou art, Manyu, of surpassing vigour, fierce, queller of the
    foe, and self-existent,
   Shared by all men, victorious, subduer: vouchsafe to us superior
    strength in battles.
 [0403205]I have departed still without a portion, wise God! according to
    thy will, the mighty.
   I, feeble man, was wroth with thee, O Manyu. Come in thy
    proper form and give us vigour.
 [0403206]Come hither, I am all thine own: advancing, turn thou to me,
    victorious, all-bestowing. [p. a142]
   Come to me, Manyu, wielder of the thunder: bethink thee of
    thy friend, and slay the Dasyus.
 [0403207]Approach, and on our right hand hold thy station, then let us
    slay a multitude of foemen.
   The best of meath I offer to support thee: may we be first to
    drink thereof in quiet.

HYMN XXXIV

  

Glorification of the Vishtari sacrifice

[0403401]The head of this is prayer, its back the Brihat, Odanas's belly is
    the Vamadevya;
   Its face reality, its sides the metre, Vishtari sacrifice produced
    from fervour.
 [0403402]Boneless, cleansed, purified by him who cleanseth, they go res-
    plendent to the world of splendour.
   Fire burneth not their organ of enjoyment: much pleasure have
    they in the world of Svarga.
 [0403403]Never doth want or evil fortune visit those who prepare oblation
    called Vishtari.
   He goes unto the Gods, he dwells with Yama, he joys among
   Gandharvas meet for Soma.
 [0403404]Yama robs not of generative vigour the men who dress oblation
    called Vishtari.
   Borne on his car, a charioteer, he travels: endowed with wings
    he soars beyond the heavens.
 [0403405]Strongest is this, performed, of sacrifices: he hath reached
    heaven who hath prepared Vishtari.
   The oval-fruited lotus spreads his fibre: there bloom the nelo-
    phar and water-lilies.
   Abundant with their overflow of sweetness, these streams shall
    reach thee in the world of Svarga, whole lakes with lotus-
    blossom shall approach thee.
 [0403406]Full lakes of butter with their banks of honey, flowing with wine,
    and milk and curds and water
   Abundant with their overflow of sweetness, these streams shall
    reach thee in the world of Svarga, whole lakes with lotus-
    blossom shall approach thee.
 [0403407]I give four pitchers, in four several places, filled to the brim with
    milk and curds and water. [p. a144]
   Abundant with their overflow of sweetness, these streams shall
    reach thee in the world of Svarga, whole lakes with lotus-
    blossom shall approach thee.
 [0403408]I part this Odana among the Brahmans, Vishtari, conquering
    worlds and reaching heaven.
   Let me not lose it: swelling by its nature, be it my perfect Cow
    to grant all wishes!

HYMN XXXV

  

Magnification of the Odana or oblation of milk and rice

[0403501]Odana which Prajapati, the firstborn of Order, dressed with
    fervour for the Brahman,
    which guards the worlds from breaking atIthe centre,--I with this
   Odana will conquer Mrityu. [p. a145]
 [0403502]Whereby the World-Creators vanquished Mrityu, that which
    they found by fervour, toil and trouble,
   That which prayer first made ready for the Brahman,--I with
    this Odana will conquer Mrityu.
 [0403503]That which upholds the Earth, the all-sustainer, that which hath
    filled air's middle realm with moisture,
   Which, raised on high in grandeur, stablished heaven,--I with
    this Odana will conquer Mrityu.
 [0403504]From which the months with thirty spokes were moulded, from
    which the twelve-spoked year was formed and fashioned.
   Which circling day and night have ne'er o'ertaken,--I with this
   Odana will conquer Mrityu.
 [0403505]Which hath become breath-giver, life-bestower; to which the
    worlds flow full of oil and fatness,
   To whom belong all the refulgent regions,--I with this Odana
    will conquer Mrityu.
 [0403506]From which, matured, sprang Amrit into being, which hath
    become Gayatris lord and ruler,
   In which the perfect Vedas have been treasured,--I with this
   Odana will conquer Mrityu,
 [0403507]I drive away the hostile God-despiser: far off be those who are
    mine adversaries,
   I dress Brahmaudana that winneth all things. May the Gods
    hear me who believe and trust them.

HYMN XXXVI

  

A charm against fiends, human enemies, and other pests

[0403601]Endowed with true strength, let the Bull, Agni Vaisvanara, burn
    them up.
   Him who would pain and injure us, him who would treat us as
    a foe. [p. a146]
 [0403602]Him who, unharmed, would injure us, and him who, harmed,
    would do us harm,
   I lay between the doubled fangs of Agni, of Vaisvanara.
 [0403603]Those who, what time the moon is dark, hunt with loud cry and
    answering shout,
   Flesh-eaters, others who would harm,--all these I overcome with
    might.
 [0403604]I conquer the Pisachas with my power, and take their wealth
    away.
   All who would injure us I slay. Let mine intention have success.
 [0403605]With Gods who flee with him, and match their rapid motion
    with the Sun,
   I with those animals who dwell in rivers and on hills am found.
 [0403606]I trouble the Pisachas as the tiger plagues men rich in kine.
   They, even as dogs when they have seen a lion, find no hiding-
    place.
 [0403607]Naught with Pisachas can I do, with thieves, with roamers of the
    wood.
   Pisachas flee and vanish from each village as I enter it.
 [0403608]Into whatever village this mine awful power penetrates,
   Thence the Pisachas flee away, and plot no further mischief
    there.
 [0403609]Those who enrage me with their prate, as flies torment an
    elephant,
   I deem unhappy creatures, like small insects troublesome to
    man.
 [0403610]Destruction seize upon the man, as with a cord they hold a
    horse,
   The fool who is enraged with me! He is not rescued from the
    noose.

A charm against Gandharvas and Apsarases

[0403701]With thee, O Plant, in olden time Atharvans smote and slew the
    fiends.
   Kasyapa smote with thee, with thee did Kanava and Agastya
    smite.
 [0403702]With thee we scare and drive away Gandharvas and Apsarases.
   O Ajasringi, chase the fiends. Cause all to vanish with thy
    smell.
 [0403703]Let the Apsarases, puffed away, go to the river, to the ford,--
   Guggulu, Pila, Naladi, Aukshagandhi, Pramandini.
   Ye have become attentive since the Apsarases have past away.
 [0403704]Where great trees are, Asvatthas and Nyagrodhas with their
    leafy crests,
   There where your swings are green and bright, and lutes and
    cymbals sound in tune,
   'Ye have become attentive since the Apsarases have past away.
 [0403705]Hither hath come this one, the most effectual of herbs and
    plants.
 [0403706]Let Ajasringi penetrate, Ara4aki with sharpened horn.
 [0403707]From the Gandharva, dancing near, the lord of the Apsarases,
   Wearing the tuft of hair, I take all manhood and virility.
 [0403708]With those dread hundred iron spears, the darts of Indra, let it
    pierce.
   The Blyxa-fed Gandharvas, those who bring no sacrificial gift.
 [0403709]With those dread hundred golden spears, the darts of Indra, let
    it pierce. [p. a148]
   The Blyxa-fed Gandharvas, those who bring no sacrificial gift.
 [0403710]O Plant, be thou victorious, crush the Pisachas, one and all,
   Blyxa-fed, shining in the floods, illumining the selfish ones.
 [0403711]Youthful, completely decked with hair, one monkey-like, one
    like a dog,--
   So the Gandharva, putting on a lovely look, pursues a dame.
   Him with an efficacious charm we scare and cause to vanish
    hence.
 [0403712]Your wives are the Apsarases, and ye, Gandharvas, are their
    lords.
   Run ye, immortal ones, away: forbear to interfere with men!

    of dice.
 [0403802]Hither I call that Apsaras who scatters and who gathers up. [p. a149]
   The Apsaras who plays with skill and takes her winnings in the
    game.
 [0403803]Dancing around us with the dice, winning the wager by her
    play.
   May she obtain the stake for us and gain the victory with skill.
   May she approach us full of strength: let them not win this
    wealth of ours.
 [0403804]Hither I call that Apsaras, the joyous, the delightful one--
   Those nymphs who revel in the dice, who suffer grief and yield
    to wrath.
 [0403805]Who follow in their course the rays of Surya, or as a particle of
    light attend him.
   Whose leader from afar, with store of riches, compasses quickly
    all the worlds and guards them.
   Pleased, may he come to this our burnt oblation, together with
    the Air, enriched with treasure.
 [0403806]Together with the Air, O rich in treasure, guard here the white
    cow and the calf, O mighty!
   Here are abundant drops for thee, come hither! Here is thy
    white calf, let thy mind be with us.
 [0403807]Together with the Air, O rich in treasure, keep the white calf in

[0500101]He who with special plans and deathless spirit, waxing, well-
    born, hath come unto his birth-place,
   As he who shines upholds the days, thus Trita, of pure life,
    bears the Three as their supporter.
 [0500102]He who, the first, approached the holy statutes makes, after,
    many beauteous forms and figures.
   Eager to drink, his birth-place first he entered who understands
    the word when yet unspoken.
 [0500103]He who--the fluid gold, with radiant kinsmen--to fervent glow
    delivered up thy body,
   On him both set names, that shall live for ever: to him the regions
    shall send robes to clothe him,
 [0500104]As these have gone to their primeval station, each gaining an
    imperishable dwelling,
   May kissing mothers of the bards' beloved bring the pole-draw-
    ing husband to the sister.
 [0500105]By holy wisdom I a sage, Far-Strider! offer to thee this lofty
    adoration.
   This worship both the mighty eddying rivers, coming together
    to this station, heighten.
 [0500106]Seven are the pathways which the wise have fashioned: to one
    of these may come the troubled mortal.
   On sure ground where the ways are parted standeth Life's Pillar
    in the dwelling of the Highest.
 [0500107]Working, I go my way with deathless spirit: life, spirit, bodies
    have gone gladly thither.
   Aye, Sakra also gives his gift of treasure as when the sacrificer
    meets with power.
 [0500108]Yea, the son asks dominion of his father: this they declared the
    noblest path to welfare.
   Varuna, let them see thy revelations: display the wondrous
    shapes of times to follow. [p. a154]
 [0500109]Halt with the milk, its other half, thou minglest and with that
    half, strong! unbeguiled! increasest.
   Let us exalt the gracious friend, the mighty, Varuna son of-
   Aditi, strength-giver.
   We have told him the marvels sung by poets. The utterance of
   Heaven and Earth is truthful.

HYMN II

  

A glorification of Indra

[0500201]In all the worlds That was the best and highest whence sprang
    the Mighty One of splendid valour.
   As soon as born he overcomes his foemen, when those rejoice in
    him who bring him succour.
 [0500202]Grown mighty in his strength, with ample vigour, he as a foe
    strikes fear into the Dasa,
   Eager to win the breathing and the breathless: All sang thy
    praise at banquet and oblation.
 [0500203]All concentrate on thee their mental vigour what time these,
    twice or thrice, are thine assistants,
   Blend what is sweeter than the sweet with sweetness win quickly
    with our meath that meath in battle.
 [0500204]If verily in every war the sages joy and exult in thee who win-
    nest treasures,
   With mightier power, strong God, extend thy firmness: let not
    malevolent Kaokas harm thee.
 [0500205]Proudly we put our trust in thee in battles, when we behold
    great wealth the prize of combat.
   I with my words impel thy weapons onward, and sharpen with
    my prayer thy vital vigour.
 [0500206]Thou in that house, the highest or the lowest, which thy protec-
    tion guards, bestowest riches.
   Establish ye the ever-wandering mother, and bring full many
    deeds to their completion.
 [0500207]Praise in the height Him who hath many pathways, courageous,
    strongest, Aptya of the Aptyas
   Through strength he shows himself of ample power: pattern of
   Prithivi, he fights and conquers.
 [0500208]Brihaddiva, the foremost of light-winners, hath made these holy
    prayers, this strength for Indra. [p. a156]
   Free Lord, he rules the mighty fold of cattle, winning, aglow,
    even all the billowy waters.
 [0500209]Thus hath Brihaddiva, the great Atharvan, spoken to Indra as
    himself in person.
   Two sisters free from stain, the Matarivans, with power impel
    him onward and exalt him.

HYMN III

  

A prayer to Agni, Indra, and other deities for victory and prosperity

[0500301]Let strength be mine while I invoke thee, Agni! enkindling thee
    may we support our bodies.
   May the four regions bend and bow before me: with thee for
    guardian may we win the combat.
 [0500302]Baffling the range of our opponents, Agni! guard us as our
    protector round about us.
   Down the steep slope go they who hate us, backward, and let
    their thought who watch at home be ruined.
 [0500303]May all the Gods be on my side in battle, the Maruts led by
   Indra, Vishnu, Agni.
   Mine be the middle air's extended region, and may the Wind
    blow favouring these my wishes.
 [0500304]For me let them present all mine oblations, and let my mind's
    intention be accomplished.
   May I be guiltless of the least transgression: may all the Gods
    come hither and protect me.
 [0500305]May the Gods grant me riches, may the blessing and invocation
    of the Gods assist me.
   This boon shall the celestial Hotars win us: may we, unwound-
    ed, have brave heroes round us.
 [0500306]Ye six divine Expanses, give us freedom. Here, all ye Gods,
    acquit yourselves like heroes.
   Let not calamity or curse o'ertake us, nor deeds of wickedness
    that merit hatred.
 [0500307]Do ye three Goddesses give ample shelter and all success to us
    ourselves and children.
   Let us not lose our children or our bodies: let us not benefit
    the foe, King Soma!
 [0500308]Foodful and much-invoked, at this our calling may the far-
    reaching Bull grant us wide shelter.
   Lord of bay coursers, Indra, bless our children: harm us not,
    give us not as prey to others.
 [0500309]Lord of the world, Creator and Disposer, may the God Savitar
    who quells assailants,
   May the Adityas, Rudras, both the Asvins, Gods, guard the
    sacrificer from destruction.
 [0500310]Let those who are our foemen stay afar from us: with Indra
    and with Agni we will drive them off. [p. a158]
   The Adityas and the Rudras, over us on high, have made me
    strong, a thinker, and a sovran lord.
 [0500311]Yea, we call Indra hitherward, the winner of wealth in battle
    and of kine and horses.
   May he mark this our worship when we call him, Lord of bay
    steeds, thou art our friend and comrade.

HYMN IV

  

A charm against fever and other ailments

[0500401]Thou who wast born on mountains, thou most mighty of all
    plants that grow.
   Thou Banisher of Fever, come, Kushtha! make Fever pass
    away.
 [0500402]Brought from the Snowy Mountain, born on the high hill where
    eagles breed,
   Men seek to buy thee when they hear: for Fever's Banisher
    they know.
 [0500403]In the third heaven above us stands the Asvattha tree, the seat
    of Gods.
   There the Gods sought the Kushtha Plant, embodiment of end-
    less life.
 [0500404]There moved through heaven a golden ship, a ship with cordage
    wrought of Gold.
   There the Gods won the Kushtha Plant, the blossom of eternal
    life. [p. a159]
 [0500405]They sailed on pathways paved with gold, the oars they piled
    were wrought of gold:
   All golden were the ships wherein they carried Kushtha down
    to earth.
 [0500406]O Kushtha, bring thou hitherward this man of mine, restore his
    health,
   Yes, free him from disease for me.
 [0500407]Thou art descended from thee Gods, Soma's benignant friend
    art thou,
   Befriend my breath and vital air be gracious unto this mine eye.
 [0500408]Sprung, northward, from the Snowy Hill thou art conveyed to
    eastern men.
   There they deal out among themselves Kushtha's most noble
    qualities.
 [0500409]Most excellent, indeed, art thou, Kushtha! most noble is thy
    sire.
   Make all Consumption pass away and render Fever powerless.
 [0500410]Malady that affects the head, eye-weakness, bodily defect--
   All this let Kushtha heal and cure: aye, godlike is the vigorous
    power.

A charm to mend a broken bone

[0500501]Aryaman is thy grandsire, Night thy mother, and the Cloud thy
    sire.
   Thy name is called Silachi. Thou, thyself, art sister of the Gods.
 [0500502]Whoever drinketh thee hath life: thou savest and protectest
    man.
   As nursing mother of mankind, thou takest all upon thy lap.
 [0500503]Thou clingest close to every tree, as a fond damsel clasps her
    love. [p. a160]
   Thy name is called The Conqueror, She who Stands Fast, The
   Rescuer.
 [0500504]Whatever wound the arrow, or the staff, or violence inflicts,
   Thereof thou art the remedy: as such restore this man to health.
 [0500505]Thou springest from blest Plaxa, or Asvattha, Dhava, Khadira,
   Parna, or blest Nyagrodha, so come thou to use, Arundhati!
 [0500506]Gold-coloured, bringing happy fate, most lovely, brilliant as the
   Sun,
   Mayst thou, O Healing! come unto the fracture: Healing is thy
    name.
 [0500507]Gold-coloured, bringing happy fate, odorous, hairy-bodied one,
   The sister of the Waters art thou, Laksha! and thy soul is Wind.
 [0500508]Silachi is thy name: thy sire, O goat-brown! is a damsel's son.
   Thou hast been sprinkled by the mouth of Yama's tawny-
    coloured horse.
 [0500509]Issuing from the horse's blood away she glided to the trees.
   Become a winged water-brook, and come to us, Arundhati!

HYMN VI

  

A prayer for protection and prosperity

[0500601]Eastward at first the prayer was generated: Vena disclosed bright
    flashes from the summit, [p. a161]
   Disclosed his deepest nearest revelations, womb of the non-
    existent and existent.
 [0500602]None have attained to those of old, those who wrought holy
    acts for you,
   Let them not harm our heroes here. Therefore I set before you
    this.
 [0500603]Sweet-tongued, exhaustless, they have sent their voices down
    together in heaven's vault that pours a thousand streams.
   His wildly-restless warders never close an eye: in every place
    the snarers stand to bind men fast.
 [0500604]Speed forward, conquering all foes, to win the spoil,
   Thou comest on thy haters with a surging sea. Thy name is
   Fragile. The thirteenth month is Indra's home.
 [0500605]Through this now hast thou sent thy gifts. All hail!
   With sharpened arms and missiles, kind and friendly, be gracious
    unto us, Soma and Rudra!
 [0500606]Through this hast thou been left in want. All hail!
   With sharpened arms and missiles, kind and friendly, be gracious
    unto us, Soma and Rudra!
 [0500607]Through this hast thou committed faults. All hail!
   With sharpened arms and missiles, kind and friendly, be gracious
    unto us, Soma and Rudra!
 [0500608]Free us from trouble, free us from dishonour, accept our wor-
    ship, give us life immortal.
 [0500609]O missile of the eye, missile of spirit, thou missile of devotion
    and of fervour!
   Thou art the weapon shot against the weapon. Let those be
    weaponless who sin against us.
 [0500610]Make with thy weapon weaponless, O Agni, all wicked men
    who deal with us as foemen with eye, with thought, with
    spirit, or intention.
 [0500611]Thou art the house of Indra. I betake me to thee, I enter thee
    with all my cattle,
   With all my people and with all my body, with all my soul, with
    mine entire possessions.
 [0500612]Thou art the guard of Indra. I betake me to thee, etc.
 [0500613]Thou art the shield of Indra. I betake me to thee, etc.
 [0500614]Indra's protection art thou. I betake me to thee, I enter thee
    with all my cattle.
   With all my people and with all my body, with all my soul, with [p. a162]
    mine entire possessions.

HYMN VII

  

A charm to deprecate Arati or Malignity

[0500701]Bring thou to us, bar not the way, Arati! Stay not the guerdon
    that is being brought us.
   Homage be paid to Failure, to Misfortune, and Malignity.
 [0500702]The man whom thou preferrest, O Arati, he who prates to us--
   This man of thine, we reverence. Baffle not thou my heart's
    desire,
 [0500703]May our desire which Gods have roused fulfil itself by day and
    night.
   We seek to win Arati: to Arati be our homage paid.
 [0500704]We, suppliant, call on Bhaga, on Sarasvati, Anumati,
   Pleasant words have I spoken, sweet as honey is, at invocations
    of the Gods.
 [0500705]The portion that I crave with speech intelligent and full of
    power,
   May faith, presented with the gift of tawny Soma, find to-day.
 [0500706]Do not thou make our words or wishes fruitless. Let the twain
   Indra Agni, bring us treasures.
   All, fain to-day to give us gifts, welcome Arati with your love. [p. a163]
 [0500707]Misfortune! go thou far away: we turn thy harmful dart aside.
   I know thee well, Arati! as oppressor, one who penetrates.
 [0500708]Oft, coming as a naked girl thou hauntest people in their sleep,
   Baffling the thought, Arati! and the firm intention of a man.
 [0500709]To her the mighty vast in size, who penetrates all points of
    space,
   To her mine homage have I paid, Nirriti with her golden hair.
 [0500710]Auspicious, with her golden hue, pillowed on gold, the mighty
    one
   To this Arati clad in robes of gold mine homage have I paid.

HYMN VIII

  

A charm for the discomfiture and destruction of hostile priests

[0500801]With fuel of Vikankata bring molten butter to the Gods.
   O Agni, make them joyful here: let them all come unto my call.
 [0500802]O Indra, come unto my call, This will I do. So hear it thou.
   Let these exertions for the sake of Indra guide my wish aright.
   Therewith, O Jatavedas, Lord of Bodies! may we win us strength.
 [0500803]Whatever plot from yonder, O ye Gods, that godless man would
    frame,
   Let not the Gods come to his call, nor Agni bear his offering up.
   Come, ye, come hither to my call.
 [0500804]Run, ye Fxertions, farther on By Indra's order smite and slay.
   As a wolf worrieth a sheep, so let not him escape from you
    while life remains. Stop fast his breath.
 [0500805]The Brahman whom those yonder have appointed priest, for
    injury,
   He, Indra! is beneath thy feet. I cast him to the God of Death.
 [0500806]If they have issued forth, strongholds of Gods, and made their
    shield of prayer, [p. a164]
   Gaining protection for their lives, protection round about, make
    all their instigation powerless.
 [0500807]Exertions which that man hath made, Exertions which he yet
    will make
   Turn them, O Indra, back again, O Vritra-slayer, back again on
    him that they may kill that man.
 [0500808]As Indra, having seized him, set his foot upon Udvachana,
   Even so for all the coming years I cast those men beneath my
    feet.
 [0500809]Here, Indra Vritra-slayer, in thy strength pierce thou their vital.
    parts.
   Here, even here, attack them, O Indra. Thine own dear friend
    am I.
   Indra, we closely cling to thee. May we be in thy favouring
    grace.

HYMN XI

  

A dialogue between Atharvan and Varuna

[0501101]How, terrible in might, hast thou here spoken to the great God,
    how to the gold-hued Father!
   Thy mind watched, greedy Varuna! to recover the brindled cow
    thou hadst bestowed as guerdon.
 [0501102]Not through desire do I revoke my present: I bring this brind-
    led cow to contemplate her.
   Now by what lore, by what inherent nature, knowest thou all
    things that exist, Atharvan?
 [0501103]Truly I am profound in wisdom, truly I know by nature all
    existing creatures.
   No Dasa by his greatness, not an Arya, may violate the law that
   I will stablish.
 [0501104]None, self-dependent Varuna! existeth wiser than thou or sager
    by his wisdom.
   Thou knowest well all these created beings: even the man of
    wondrous powers fears thee.
 [0501105]O self-dependent Varuna, wise director, thou knowest verily all
    generations.
   What is, unerring one! beyond this region? What more remote
    than that which is most distant?
 [0501106]One thing there is beyond this air, and something beyond that
    one, most hard to reach, remotest.
   I, Varuna, who know, to thee declare it. Let churls be mighty [p. a167]
    in the lower regions. Let Dasas sink into the earth beneath
    them.
 [0501107]Many reproaches, Varuna, dost thou utter against the misers.
    who revoke their presents.
   Be not thou added to that crowd of niggards: let not men call
    thee an illiberal giver.
 [0501108]Let not men call me an illiberal giver. I give thee back the
    brindled cow, O singer.
   Attend in every place where men inhabit, with all thy powers,
    the hymn that tells my praises.
 [0501109]Let hymns of praise ascend to thee, uplifted in every place of
    human habitation.
   But give me now the gift thou hast not given. Thou art my
    friend for ever firm and faithful.
 [0501110]One origin, Varuna! one bond unites us I know the nature of
    that common kinship.
   I give thee now the gift that I retracted. I am thy friend for ever
    firm and faithful.
 [0501111]God, giving life unto the god who lauds me, Sage strengthener
    of the sage who sings my praises.
   Thou, self-dependent Varuna! hast begotten the kinsman of the
   Gods, our sire Atharvan.
   On him bestow most highly-lauded riches. Thou art our friend,
    high over all, our kinsman.

An Apri or propitiatory hymn

[0501201]Thou in the house of man this day enkindled worshippest Gods
    as God, O Jatavedas.
   Observant, bright as Mitra, bring them hither. Thou art a
    sapient and foreknowing envoy.
 [0501202]Tanunapat, fair-tongued! with sweet meath balming the baths
    and ways of Order, make them pleasant.
   Bear to the Gods our sacrifice, exalting with holy thoughts our
    hymns of praise and worship.
 [0501203]Invoked, deserving prayer and adoration, O Agni, come accor
    dant with the Vasus.
   Thou art, O youthful Lord, the Gods' Invoker, so, best of sacri-
    ficers, bring them quickly.
 [0501204]By rule the Sacred Grass is scattered eastward, a robe to clothe
    this earth when dawns are breaking.
   Widely it spreads around and far extended, fair for the Gods
    and bringing peace and freedom,
 [0501205]Let the expansive Doors be widely opened, like wives who deck
    their beauty for their husbands.
   Lofty, celestial, all-impelling Portals, admit the Gods and give
    them easy entrance!
 [0501206]Pouring sweet dews let holy Night and Morning, each close to
    each, be seated at their station,--
   Lofty, celestial Dames with gold to deck them, assuming all
    their fair and radiant beauty.
 [0501207]Come the first two celestial sweet-voiced Hotars, arranging
    sacrifice for man to worship, [p. a169]
   As singers who inspire us in assemblies, showing the eastern
    light with their direction!
 [0501208]Let Bharati come quickly to our worship and Ila showing like a
    human being.
   So let Sarasvati and both her fellows, deft Goddesses, on this
    fair grass be seated.
 [0501209]Hotar more skilled in sacrifice, bring hither with speed to-day
   God Tvashar, thou who knowest,
   Even him who formed these two, the Earth and Heaven, the
   Parents, with their forms, and every creature.
 [0501210]Bring thou to our oblations which thou balmest the companies
    of Gods in ordered season.
   Agni, Vanaspati, the Immolator sweeten our offered gifts with
    meath and butter!
 [0501211]Agni as soon as he was born made ready the sacrifice and was
    the Gods' preceder.
   May the Gods eat our offering consecrated according to this true
   Priest's voice and guidance.

[0501301]Varuna, Sage of heaven, hath given me the gift: with spells of
    mighty power I draw thy poison out.
   Dug up, not dug, adherent, I have seized it fast: low hath thy
    venom sunk like water in the sands.
 [0501302]All the non-fluid portion of thy venom, I receive in these.
   I take thy middlemost, thy highest, lowest juice: may it be
    spent and lest by reason of thy fear.
 [0501303]Strong is my cry like thunder with the rainy cloud: with power-
    ful incantation let thy strength be stayed.
   I, with the men to aid, have seized that juice of his; as light
    from out the gloom, let Surya rise on high
 [0501304]I with this eye destroy thine eye, and with this poison conquer
    thine.
   Live not, O Snake, but die the death: back go thy venom on
    thyself.
 [0501305]Listen to me, Black Snakes and hateful creatures, Lurker-in-
   Grass, Karait, and Brown, and Spotty,
   Approach not near the house my friend inhabits: give warning,
    and rest quiet with your poison.
 [0501306]Even as the cord that strings the bow, I slacken, as it were, the
    cars.
   Of the All-conquering serpent's wrath, of the fierce rage of
   Black, and Brown, Taimata, and Apodaka.
 [0501307]And Aligi and Viligi, their father and the mother too,--
   What will ye do? Your venomed sap, we know, is utterly
    powerless.
 [0501308]Daughter of Urugula, she-fiend whom the black, skinned mother
    bare--
   All female serpents poison who crept swiftly near is impotent.
 [0501309]Dwelling beside the mountain's slope, the quick-eared porcupine
    exclaimed:
   Of all these she-snakes homed in earth the poison is most
    powerless.
 [0501310]Tabuva or not Tabuva, thou verily art not Tabuva: poison is
    killed by Tabuva. [p. a171]
   Tastuva or not Tastuva, thou verily art not Tastuva: poison is
    killed by Tastuva.

A charm against witchcraft

[0501401]An eagle found thee: with his snout a wild boar dug thee from
    the earth.
   Harm thou, O Plant, the mischievous, and drive the sorcerer
    away.
 [0501402]Beat thou the Yatudhanas back, drive thou away the sorcerer;
   And chase afar, O Plant, the man who fain would do us injury.
 [0501403]As 'twere a strip cut round from skin of a white-footed an-
    telope,
   Bind, like a golden chain, O God, his witchcraft on the sorcerer.
 [0501404]Take thou his sorcery by the hand, and to the sorcerer lead it
    back.
   Lay it before him, face to face, that it may kill the sorcerer.
 [0501405]Back on the wizard fall his craft, upon the curser light his
    curse! [p. a172]
   Let witchcraft, like a well-naved car, roll back upon the
    sorcerer.
 [0501406]Whoso, for other's harm hath dealt-woman or man-in magic
    arts,
   To him we lead the sorcery back, even as a courser with a rope.
 [0501407]Now whether thou hast been prepared by Gods or been pre-
    pared by men,
   We, with our Indra at our side to aid us, lead thee back again.
 [0501408]Agni, victorious in fight, subdue the armies of our foes!
   Back on the sorcerer we cast his sorcery, and beat it home.
 [0501409]Thou who hast piercing weapons, pierce him who hath wrought
    it; conquer him.
   We do not sharpen thee to slay the man who hath not practised
    it.
 [0501410]Go as a son goes to his sire: bite as a trampled viper bites.
   As one who flies from bonds, go back, O Witchcraft, to the
    sorcerer.
 [0501411]Even as the timid antelope or hind from her assailant flees,
   So swiftly let the sorcery o'ertake and reach the sorcerer.
 [0501412]Straighter than any arrow let it fly against him, Heaven and
   Earth.
   So let that witchcraft seize again the wizard like a beast of
    chase.
 [0501413]Let it go contrary like flame, like water following its course.
   Let witchcraft, like a well-naved car, roll back upon the
    sorcerer.

HYMN XVII

  

The abduction and restoration of a Brahman's wife

[0501701]These first, the boundless Sea, and Matarisvan, fierce glowing
   Fire, the Strong, the Bliss-bestower,
   And heavenly Floods, first-born by holy Order, exclaimed
    against the outrage on a Brahman.
 [0501702]King Soma first of all, without reluctance, made restitution of
    the Brahman's consort.
   Mitra and Varuna were the inviters: Agni as Hotar took her
    hand and led her.
 [0501703]The man, her pledge, must by the hand be taken when he hath
    cried, She is a Brahman's consort.
   She stayed not for a herald to conduct her: thus is the kingdom
    of a ruler guarded.
 [0501704]She whom they call the star with loosened tresses, descending as.
    misfortune on the village, [p. a174]
   The Brahman's consort, she disturbs the kingdom where hath
    appeared the hare with fiery flashing.
 [0501705]Active in duty serves the Brahmachari: he is a member of the
   Gods' own body.
   Through him Brihaspati obtained his consort, as the Gods gained
    the ladle brought by Soma.
 [0501706]Thus spake of her those Gods of old, Seven Rishis, who sate
    them down to their austere devotion:
   Dire is a Brahman's wife led home by others: in the supremest
    heaven she plants confusion.
 [0501707]When infants die, untimely born, when herds of cattle waste
    away,
   When heroes strike each other dead, the Brahman's wife
    destroyeth them.
 [0501708]Even if ten former husbands--none a Brahman--had espoused a
    dame,
   And then a Brahman took her hand, he is her husband, only he,
 [0501709]Not Vaisya, not Rajanya, no, the Brahman is indeed her lord:
   This Surya in his course proclaims to the Five Races of man-
    kind.
 [0501710]So then the Gods restored her, so men gave the woman back
    again.
   Princes who kept their promises restored the Brahman's wedded
    wife.
 [0501711]Having restored the Brahman's wife, and freed them, with Gods'
    aid, from sin,
   They shared the fulness of the earth and worn themselves ex-
    tended sway.
 [0501712]No lovely wife who brings her dower in hundreds rests upon his
    bed,
   Within whose kingdom is detained, through want of sense, a
   Brahman's dame.
 [0501713]No broad-browed calf with wide-set ears is ever in his homestead
    born.
   Within whose kingdom is detained, through want of sense, a
   Brahman's dame.
 [0501714]No steward, golden-necklaced, goes before the meat-trays of the
    man.
   Within whose kingdom is detained, through want of sense, a
   Brahman's dame. [p. a175]
 [0501715]No black-eared courser, white of hue, moves proudly, harnessed
    to his car,
   In whose dominion is detained, through want of sense, a
   Brahman's dame.
 [0501716]No lily grows with oval bulbs, no lotus-pool is in his field,
   In whose dominion is detained, through senseless love, a
   Brahman's dame.
 [0501717]The men whose task it is to milk drain not the brindled cow for
    him,
   In whose dominion is detained, through senseless love, a
   Brahman's dame.
 [0501718]His milch-cow doth not profit one, his draught-ox masters not
    the yoke,
   Wherever, severed from his wife, a Brahman spends the mourn-
    ful night.

HYMN XVIII

  

The wickedness of oppressing and robbing Brahmans

[0501801]The Gods, O Prince, have not bestowed this cow on thee to eat
    thereof.
   Seek not, Rajanya, to devour the Brahman's cow which none
    may eat.
 [0501802]A base Rajanya, spoiled at dice, and ruined by himself, may eat.
   The Brahman's cow and think, To-day and not tomorrow, let
    me live!
 [0501803]The Brahman's cow is like a snake, charged with due poison,
    clothed with skin.
   Rajanya! bitter to the taste is she, and none may eat of her.
 [0501804]She takes away his strength, she mars his splendour, she ruins
    everything like fire enkindled.
   That man drinks poison of the deadly serpent who counts the
   Brahman as mere food to feed him.
 [0501805]Whoever smites him, deeming him a weakling-blasphemer,
    coveting his wealth through folly
   Indra sets fire alight within his bosom. He who acts thus is
    loathed by Earth and Heaven.
 [0501806]No Brahman must be injured, safe as fire from him who loves
    himself.
   For Soma is akin to him and Indra guards him from the curse.
 [0501807]The fool who eats the Brahmans' food and thinks it pleasant to
    the taste,
   Eats, but can ne'er digest, the cow that bristles with a hundred
    barbs,
 [0501808]His voice an arrow's neck, his tongue a bowstring, his windpipes
    fire-enveloped heads of arrows, [p. a177]
   With these the Brahman pierces through blasphemers, with
   God-sped bows that quell the hearts within them.
 [0501809]Keen arrows have the Brahmans, armed with missiles: the shaft,
    when they discharge it, never faileth.
   Pursuing him with fiery zeal and anger, they pierce the foeman
    even from a distance.
 [0501810]They who, themselves ten hundred, were the rulers of a thousand
    men,
   The Vaitahavyas, were destroyed for that they ate a Brahman's
    cow.
 [0501811]The cow, indeed, when she was slain o'erthrew those Vaitahavyas,
    who
   Cooked the last she-goat that remained of Kesaraprabandha's
    flock.
 [0501812]One and a hundred were the folk, those whom the earth shook
    off from her:
   When they had wronged the Brahman race they perished incon-
    ceivably.
 [0501813]Among mankind the Gods' despiser moveth: he hath drunk
    poison, naught but bone is left him.
   Who wrongs the kinsman of the Gods, the Brahman, gains not
    the sphere to which the Fathers travelled.
 [0501814]Agni, in sooth, is called our guide, Soma is called our next of
    kin.
   Indra quells him who curses us. Sages know well that this is so.
 [0501815]Prince! like a poisoned arrow, like a deadly snake, O lord of
    kine!
   Dire is the Brahman's arrow: he pierces his enemies therewith.

HYMN XIX

  

The wickedness of robbing or insulting Brahmans

[0501901]The sons of Vitahavya, the Srinjayas, waxed exceeding strong.
   They well-nigh touched the heavens, but they wronged Bhrigu
    and were overthrown.
 [0501902]When men pierced Brihatsaman through, the Brahman, son of
   Angiras,
   The ram with teeth in both his jaws, the sheep, devoured their
    progeny.
 [0501903]If men have spat upon, or shot their rheum upon a Brahman,
    they.
   Sit in the middle of a stream running with blood, devouring
    hair.
 [0501904]While yet the Brahman's cow which men are dressing quivers in
    her throe:
   She mars the kingdom's splendour: there no vigorous hero
    springs to life.
 [0501905]Terrible is her cutting-up: her bitter flesh is cast away,
   And it is counted sin among the Fathers if her milk is drunk.
 [0501906]If any King who deems himself mighty would eat a Brahman
    up,
   Rent and disrupted is that realm wherein a Brahman is oppres-
    sed.
 [0501907]She grows eight-footed, and four-eyed, four-eared, four-jawed,
    two-faced, two-tongued,
   And shatters down the kingdom of the man who doth the
   Brahman wrong.
 [0501908]As water swamps a leaky ship so ruin overflows that realm.
   Misfortune smites the realm wherein a Brahman suffers scath
    and harm.
 [0501909]The very trees repel the man, and drive him from their sheltering
    shade,
   Whoever claims, O Narada, the treasure that a Brahman owns. [p. a179]
 [0501910]That wealth, King Varuna hath said, is poison by the Gods
    prepared.
   None hath kept watch to guard his realm who hath devoured a
   Brahman's cow.
 [0501911]Those nine-and-ninety people whom Earth shook and cast away
    from her,
   When they had wronged the Brahman race were ruined incon-
    ceivably.
 [0501912]Oppressor of the Brahmans! thus the Gods have spoken and
    declared,
   The step-effacing wisp they bind upon the dead shall be thy
    couch.
 [0501913]Oppressor of the Brahmans! tears wept by the man who suffers
    wrong,
   These are the share of water which the Gods have destined to be
    thine.
 [0501914]The share of water which the Gods have destined to be thine, is
    that,
   Oppressor of the priest! wherewith men lave the corpse and wet
    the beard.
 [0501915]The rain of Mitra-Varuna falls not on him who wrongs the
    priest.
   To him no counsel brings success: he wins, no friend to do his
    will.

A hymn to the War-drum to secure victory

[0502001]Formed out of wood, compact with straps of leather, loud is the:
   War-drum as he plays the hero.
   Whetting thy voice and vanquishing opponents, roar at them
    like a lion fain to conquer!
 [0502002]The fastened frame hath roared as 'twere a lion, like a bull bel-
    lowing to meet the heifer.
   Thou art a bull, thine enemies are weaklings: thine is the foe-
    subduing strength of Indra.
 [0502003]Like a bull marked by strength among the cattle, roar seeking
    kine and gathering up the booty.
   Pierce through our adversaries' heart with sorrow, and let our
    routed foes desert their hamlets.
 [0502004]Victorious in the battle, loudly roaring, seizing what may be
    seized, look all around thee.
   Utter, O Drum, thy heavenly voice with triumph. Bring, as a
    priest, our enemies' possessions.
 [0502005]Hearing the Drum's far-reaching voice resounding, let the foe's
    dame, waked by the roar, afflicted,
   Grasping her son, run forward in her terror amid the conflict of
    the deadly weapons.
 [0502006]Thou, first of all, O Drum, thy voice shalt utter: over the ridge
    of earth speak forth exultant.
   Crunching with might the army of the foemen, declare thy
    message pleasantly and clearly.
 [0502007]Loud be thy roar between the earth and heaven. Swift let thy
    sounds go forth in all directions.
   Neigh at them, thunder, set in opposition, song-maker, good
    ally that friends may conquer. [p. a181]
 [0502008]He shall send forth his voice whom art hath fashioned. Make
    thou the weapons of our warriors bristle.
   With Indra for ally call out our heroes, and with thy friends
    scatter and chase the foemen
 [0502009]Resonant, roaring, with thy powerful weapons, warning, and
    heard by troops in many places,
   Knowing all rules and winning us advantage, deal fame to many
    where two kings are fighting.
 [0502010]Bent on advantage, mightier, gaining treasures, victor in war,
    the spell hath made thee keener.
   As, in the press, the stone to stalks of Soma, thus, Drum! go
    dancing to our foes' possessions.
 [0502011]Foe-conqueror, victor, vanquishing opponents, seeker of booty,
    mastering, destroying.
   Speak out as a skilled speaker tells his counsel, speak strength
    to us that we may win the battle.
 [0502012]Shaker of things unshaken, readiest corner to battles; conquer-
    ing foes, resistless leader,
   Guarded by Indra, watching our assemblies, go quickly, breaker
    of their hearts who hate us.

A hymn to the War-drum and various deities for victory

[0502101]Speak to our enemies, O Drum, discouragement and wild
    dismay.
   We bring upon our foemen fear and discord and discomfiture.
   Drum! drive these enemies away.
 [0502102]When sacrificial butter hath been offered, let our foemen flee.
   Through consternation, terrified, trembling in mind and eye and
    heart.
 [0502103]Wrought out of wood, compact with straps of leather, dear to
    all the clan, [p. a182]
   Bedewed with sacrificial oil, speak terror to our enemies.
 [0502104]As the wild creatures of the wood flee in their terror from a
    man,
   Even so do thou, O Drum, roar out against our foes to frighten
    them, and then bewilder thou their thoughts.
 [0502105]As, when the wolf approaches, goats and sheep run sorely
    terrified,
   Even so do thou, O Drum, roar out against our foes to frighten
    them, and then bewilder thou their thoughts.
 [0502106]As birds of air, day after day, fly in wild terror from the hawk,
    as from a roaring lion's voice,
   Even so do thou, O Drum, roar out against our foes to frighten
    them, and then bewilder thou their thoughts.
 [0502107]May all the deities whose might controls the fortune of the fray
   Frighten away our enemies with Drum and skin of antelope.
 [0502108]Let those our enemies who go yonder in their battalions shake.
   In fear at shadows and the sounds of feet which Indra sporteth
    with.
 [0502109]To all the quarters of the sky let clang of bowstrings and our
   Drums.
   Cry out to hosts of foes that go discomfited in serried ranks.
 [0502110]Aditya, take their sight away! Follow them close, ye motes of
    light.
   Let them cleave fast to foot-bound hosts when strength of arm
    hath past away.
 [0502111]Do ye, O mighty Maruts, sons of Prisni, crush down, with
   Indra for ally, our foemen.
   King Soma. Varuna, great God and sovran, Indra too, aye,
   Death,--
 [0502112]May these embattled Gods, brilliant as Surya--All hail!--one-
    minded conquer those who hate us.

A charm against fever

[0502201]Hence, filled with holy strength let Agni, Soma, and Varuna,
    the Press-stone, and the Altar.
   And Grass, and glowing Fuel banish Fever. Let hateful things
    stay at a distance yonder.
 [0502202]And thou thyself who makest all men yellow, consuming them
    with burning heat like Agni,
   Thou, Fever! then be weak and ineffective. Pass hence into the
    realms below or vanish.
 [0502203]Endowed with universal power! send Fever down-ward, far
    away,
   The spotty, like red-coloured dust, sprung from a spotty
    ancestor.
 [0502204]When I have paid obeisance to Fever I send him downward
    forth.
   So let Sakambhara's boxer go again to the Mahavrishas.
 [0502205]His mansions are the Mujavans, and the Mahavrishas his home,
   Thou, Fever, ever since thy birth hast lived among the Bahlikas.
 [0502206]Fever, snake, limbless one, speak out! Keep thyself far away
    fi om us.
   Seek thou a wanton Dast girl and strike her with thy thunder-
    bolt.
 [0502207]Go, Fever, to the Mujavans, or, farther, to the Bahlikas.
   Seek a lascivious Sara girl and seem to shake her through and
    through.
 [0502208]Go hence and eat thy kinsmen the Mahavrishas and Mujavans.
   These or those foreign regions we proclaim to Fever for his
    home.
 [0502209]In a strange land thou joyest not; subdued, thou wilt be kind
    to us.
   Fever is eager to depart, and to the Bahlikas will go,
 [0502210]Since thou now cold, now burning hot, with cough besides, hast
    made us shake,
   Terrible, Fever, are thy darts: forbear to injure us with these.
 [0502211]Take none of these to be thy friends, Cough, or Consumption
    or Decline:
   Never come thence again to us! O Fever, thus I counsel thee.
 [0502212]Go, Fever, with Consumption, thy brother, and with thy sister,
   Cough. [p. a184]
   And with thy nephew Herpes, go away unto that alien folk.
 [0502213]Chase Fever whether cold or hot, brought by the summer or
    the rains,
   Tertian, intermittent, or autumnal, or continual.
 [0502214]We to Gandharis, Mujavans, to Angas and to Magadhas.
   Hand over Fever as it were a servant and a thing of price.

A charm against parasitic worms

[0502301]I have called Heaven and Earth to aid, have called divine
   Sarasvati,
   Indra and Agni have I called: Let these destroy the worm, I
    prayed.
 [0502302]O Indra, Lord of Treasures, kill the worms that prey upon this
    boy.
   All the malignant spirits have been smitten by my potent spell. [p. a185]
   We utterly destroy the worm, the worm that creeps around the
    eyes.
   The worm that crawls about the nose, the worm that gets bet-
    ween the teeth.
 [0502303]Two of like colour, two unlike, two coloured black, two
    coloured red.
   The tawny and the tawny-eared, Vulture and Wolf, all these
    are killed.
 [0502304]Worms that are white about the sides, those that are black with
    black-hued arms,
   All that show various tints and hues, these worms we utterly
    destroy.
 [0502305]Eastward the Sun is mounting, seen of all, destroying thing
    unseen,
   Crushing and killing all the worms invisible and visible.
 [0502306]Let the Yevashas, Kaskashas, Ejatkas, Sipavitnukas,
   Let both the worm that we can see, and that we see not, be
    destroyed.
 [0502307]Slain the Yevasha of the worms, slain too is the Nadaniman.
   I have reduced them all to dust like vetches with the pounding-
    stone.
 [0502308]The worm Saranga, white of hue, three-headed, with a triple
    hump,
   I split and tear his ribs away, I wrench off every head he has.
 [0502309]I kill you, worms, as Atri, as Kanva and Jamadagni killed.
   I crush the worms to pieces with a spell that erst Agastya used.
 [0502310]The King of worms hath been destroyed, he who was lord of
    these is slain.
   Slain is the worm whose mother, whose brother and sister have
    been slain.
 [0502311]Destroyed are his dependants, who those dwell around him are
    destroyed,

   The Soma-drinking Gods have given a son to thee, thy son and

HYMN XXVIII

  

A charm to ensure general protection and prosperity

[0502801]For lengthened life, to last through hundred autumns, they
    equalize with nine the nine aspirations.
   Three in gold, three in silver, three in iron by heat are stablished
    in their several places.
 [0502802]May Agni, Sun, and Moon, and Earth, and Waters, Sky, Air,
    the Quarters and the Points between them,
   And Parts of Years accordant with the Seasons by this three-
    threaded Amulet preserve me.
 [0502803]In three-threaded Charm rest triple fulness! Let Pushan cover it
    with milk and butter.
   Here rest abundant store of food and people, may ample store
    of cattle rest within it.
 [0502804]Enrich this charm, Adityas, with your treasure; magnify this,
    when magnified, O Agni.
   Endow it with heroic strength, O Indra: therein be lodged a
    triple power of increase.
 [0502805]With gold let Earth protect thee, and with iron, accordant, all-
    sustaining Agni save thee!
   And in accordance with the plants may silver, regarding thee
    with favour, grant thee vigour.
 [0502806]This gold, born threefold at its first production, grew the one
    thing that Agni loved most dearly: it fell away, one part of
    injured Soma.
   One part they call seed of the sapient Waters. This gold bring
    thee long life when triply threaded!
 [0502807]Three lives of Jamadagni, thrice the vital force of Kasyapa,
   Three sights of immortality, three lives have I prepared for thee.
 [0502808]When with the three-stringed charm came three strong eagles,
    sharing the Sacred Syllable and mighty,
   With immortality they drove off Mrityu, obscuring and conceal-
    ing all distresses.
 [0502809]The golden guard thee from the sky, the silvern guard thee from
    the air,
   The iron guard thee from the earth! This man hath reached the
    forts of Gods.
 [0502810]May these three castles of the Gods keep thee secure on every
    side.
   Endowed with strength, possessing these, be thou the master of
    thy foes, [p. a192]
 [0502811]The God who first bound on in the beginning the deities' im-
    mortal golden castle,--
   Him I salute with ten extended fingers. Blest be the three-
    stringed charm I bind upon thee.
 [0502812]Aryaman be thy binder-on, and Pushan and Brihaspati:
   Whatever name the brood of day possess, therewith we fasten
    thee.
 [0502813]With Seasons and with Lengths of Time, for vigour and exten-
    ded life,
   With all the splendour of the Sun we fasten thee about the neck.
 [0502814]Drawn forth from butter and with meath besprinkled, firm as
    the earth, unshakable, triumphant.
   Breaking down foes and casting them beneath me, be fastened
    on me for exalted fortune!

HYMN XXIX

  

A charm for the destruction of malignant goblins

[0502901]Made ready in the east drive forth, take notice of what is hap-
    pening here, omniscient Agni! [p. a193]
   Thou bringest medicine and healest sickness: through thee may
    we win horses, kine, and people.
 [0502902]Accordant with all Gods, O Jatavedas Agni, perform this work
    as we beseech thee,
   That this defence of his may fall, whoever hath caused us pain,
    whoever hath consumed us.
 [0502903]Unanimous, with all the Gods together, so do this thing O Agni
   Jatavedas, that this defence of his may fall and fail him.
 [0502904]Pierce both his eyes, pierce thou the heart within him, crush
    thou his teeth and cleave his tongue asunder.
   Rend thou, most youthful Agni, that Pisacha whoso amid them
    all of this hath eaten.
 [0502905]Whatever of his body hath been taken, plundered, borne off, or
    eaten by Pisachas,
   This, Agni, knowing it, again bring hither! We give back flesh
    and spirit to his body.
 [0502906]If some Pisacha in my food raw, ready, thoroughly cooked, or,
    spotty, hath deceived me,
   Let the Pisachas with their lives and offspring atone for this,
    and let this man be healthy.
 [0502907]If one hath cheated me in milk or porridge, in food from grain
    or plants that need no culture.
   Let the Pisachas, etc.
 [0502908]If one, flesh eater, in a draught of water have wronged me lying
    in the bed of goblins,
   Let the Pisachas, etc.
 [0502909]If one, flesh-eater, in the day or night-time have wronged me
    lying in the bed of goblins,
   Let the Pisachas, etc.
 [0502910]O Agni Jatavedas, slay the bloody Pisacha, flesh-devourer, mind-
    destroyer,
   Strong Indra strike him with his bolt of thunder, courageous
   Soma cut his head to pieces!
 [0502911]Thou, Agni, ever slayest Yatudhanas, the fiends have never con-
    quered thee in battles.
   Consume thou from the root the flesh-devourers, let none of
    them escape thy heavenly weapon
 [0502912]Collect, O Jatavedas, what hath been removed and borne away.
   Let this man's members grow, let him swell like the tendril of a
    plant. [p. a194]
 [0502913]Like as the Soma's tendril, thus, O Jatavedas let him swell,
   Let him live, Agni I Make him fat, free from consumption, full
    of sap.
 [0502914]Here, Agni, is the fuel, here are logs that crush Pisachas down.
   O Jatavedas, willingly accept them and be pleased therewith.
 [0502915]Accept, O Agni, with thy flame the billets of Tarshtagha wood.
   Let the flesh-eater who would take the flesh of this man lose his
    form.

HYMN XXX

  

A charm to restore life and health

[0503001]From thy vicinity I call, from near, from far, from night at
    hand.
   Stay here: depart not: follow not the Fathers of the olden
    time. I bind thy vital spirit fast.
 [0503002]If any man, a stranger or akin, hath cast a spell on thee,
   I with my voice to thee declare thy freedom and release there-
    from.
 [0503003]If in thy folly thou hast lied or cursed a woman or a man,
   I with my voice declare to thee thy freedom and release there-
    from. [p. a195]
 [0503004]If thou art lying there because of mother's or of father's sin,
   I with my voice declare to thee thy freedom and release there-
    from.
 [0503005]Accept the healing medicine, the balm thy mother and thy sire,
   Thy sister and thy brother bring. I make thee live through
    lengthened years.
 [050306]O man, stay here among us; stay with all thy spirit: follow not
   Yama's two messengers. Approach the castles where the living
    dwell.
 [0503007]Come back as thou art called to come, knowing the outlet of
    the path,
   And the Approach and its ascent, the way of every living man.
 [0503008]Be not alarmed: thou wilt not die. I give thee lengthened years
    of life.
   Forth from thy members have I charmed Decline that caused
    the fever there.
 [0503009]Gone is the pain that racked thee, gone thy fever, gone thy
    heart's disease.
   Consumption, conquered by my voice, hath, like a hawk, fled
    far away.
 [0503010]Two sages, Sense and Vigilance, the sleepless and the watchful
    one,
   These, the protectors of thy life, shall be awake both day and
    night.
 [0503011]This Agni must be waited on. Here let the Sun mount up for
    thee.
   Rise from deep death and come away, yea, from black darkness
    rise thou up!
 [0503012]Homage be paid to Yama, to Mrityu, and to the Fathers, and to
    those who guide us!
   I honour first, for this man's preservation, that Agni who well
    knoweth how to save him.
 [0503013]Let breath and mind return to him, let sight and vigour come
    again
   Let all his body be restored and firmly stand upon its feet.
 [0503014]Provide this man with breath and sight, O Agni, and with his
    body and his strength unite him.
   Thou knowest Amrit: let him not go hence, nor dwell in house
    of clay.
 [0503015]Let not thine inward breathing fail, let not thine outward breath [p. a196]
    be lost.
   Let Surya who is Lord Supreme raise thee from death with
    beams of light.
 [0503016]Tied, tremulously moving, here the tongue is speaking in the
    mouth.
   With thee I charmed Decline away and Fever's hundred ago-
    nies.
 [0503017]This living world, unconquered of the Gods, is most beloved of
    all.
   To whatsoever death thou wast destined when thou wast born,.
   O man,
   This death and we call after thee. Die not before decrepit age!

    again on them.
 [0503102]The spell that they have cast for thee on jungle-cock, goat,
    horned ram,
   The witchcraft wrought upon thy ewe, this I strike back again
    on them.

    hooves,
   The ass with teeth in both his jaws, this I strike back again on
    them.
 [0503104]The secret spell upon thy plants Amula or Narachi, spell
   That they have cast upon thy field, this I strike back again on
    them.

    human bones,--
   Mroka, consuming, cannibal, this I throw back again on them.
 [0503110]He brought this by no proper path, by the right path we drive it
    back.
   The fool in folly brought it to those who observe established
    bounds.
 [0503111]No power had he who wrought the spell: he hurt his foot, he
    broke his toe.
   Unlucky for his wealthy lords, he hath wrought happiness for us.
 [0503112]May Indra slay with mighty bolt, may Agni with his missible
    pierce. [p. a198]
   The sorcerer who brings the curse, who deals with roots and
    secret spells.

Praise of Vishnu and Varuna

[0702501]The early morning prayer hath come to Vishnu and Varuna,
   Lords through might, whom none hath equalled,
   Gods by whose power the realms of air were stablished, strongest
    and most heroic in their vigour.
 [0702502]The early prayer hath ever come to Vishnu and Varuna by that
   God's high power and statute.
   In whose control is all this world that shineth, all that hath
    powers to see and all that breatheth.

HYMN XXVI

  

Praise of Vishnu

[0702601]I will declare the mighty deeds of Vishnu, of him who measured
    out the earthly regions, [p. a281]
   Who propped the highest place of congregation, thrice setting
    down his footstep, widely striding.
 [0702602]Loud boast doth Vishnu make of this achievement, like some
    wild beast, dread, prowling, mountain-roaming.
   May he approach us from the farthest distance.
 [0702603]Thou within whose three wide-extended paces all worlds and
    creatures have their habitation,
   Drink oil, thou homed in oil! promote the sacrificer more and
    more.
 [0702604]Through all this world strode Vishnu: thrice his foot he planted,
    and the whole
   Was gathered in his footstep's dust.
 [0702605]Vishnu the guardian, he whom none deceiveth, made three steps,
    thenceforth.
   Establishing these high decrees.
 [0702606]Look ye on Vishnu's works, whereby the friend of Indra, close-
    allied,
   Hath let his holy ways be seen.
 [0702607]The princes evermore behold that loftiest place where Vishnu is,
   Like an extended eye in heaven,
 [0702608]From heaven, O Vishnu, or from earth, O Vishnu, or from the
    great far-spreading air's mid-region,
   Fill both thy hands full of abundant treasures, and from the
    right and left bestow them freely.

[0705001]As evermore the lightning flash strikes, irresistible, the tree,
   So, irresistible, may I conquer the gamblers with the dice. [p. a290]
 [0705002]From every side, from hale and sick, impotent to defend them-
    selves,
   May all the fortune of the folk as winnings pass into my hands.
 [0705003]I pray to Agni, him who guards his treasure: here, won by
    homage, may he pile our winnings.
   As 'twere with racing cars I bring my presents: duly with
    reverence, let me laud the Maruts.
 [0705004]With thee to aid us may we win the treasure: do thou assist
    our side in every battle.
   Give us wide room and easy way, O Indra; break down, O
   Maghavan, the foemen's valour.
 [0705005]I have completely cleaned thee out, won from thee what thou
    keptest back.
   As a wolf tears and rends a sheep, so do I tear thy stake away.
 [0705006]Yea, by superior play one gains advantage: in time he piles his
    spoil as doth a gambler.
   He overwhelms with wealth's inherent powers the devotee who
    keeps not back his riches.
 [0705007]May we all, much-invoked! repel with cattle want that brings
    sin, hunger with store of barley.
   May we uninjured, first among the princes, obtain possessions
    by our own exertions.

    flowing milk!
   And, as the bowstring binds, the bow, unite me with a stream of
    gains.

[0705301]As thou, Brihaspati, from the curse hast saved us, from dwel-

   The Asvins, leeches of the Gods, O Agni, have chased Death
    far from us with mighty powers.
 [0705302]Move both together; do not leave the body. Let both the
    breathings stay for thee united.
   Waxing in strength live thou a hundred autumns. Thy noblest
    guardian and thy lord is Agni. [p. a292]
 [0705303]Return, thy life now vanished into distance! Return, the breath
    thou drawest and exhalest!
   Agni hath snatched it from Destruction's bosom: into thyself
    again I introduce it.
 [0705304]Let not the vital breath he draws forsake him, let not his
    expiration part and leave him.
   I give him over to the Seven Rishis: let them conduct him to
    old age in safety.
 [0705305]Enter him, both ye breaths, like two draught-oxen entering their
    stall.
   Let him, the treasure of old age, still wax in strength, uninjured,.
    here.
 [0705306]I send thee back thy vital breath; I drive Consumption far from
    thee,
   May Agni here, most excellent, sustain our life on every side.
 [0705307]From out the depth of darkness, we, ascending to the highest
    heaven,
   Have come to the sublimest light, to Surya, God among the.
   Gods.

A charm against poisonous bites and stings

[0705601]Whether it came from viper, from black snake or snake with

    less.
 [0705602]Honey-born, honey-dropping, rich in honey, honeysweet, this
    herb,
   Is medicine that heals the wound and kills the gnat that bites
    and stings.
 [0705603]Whatever bit, or sucked thy blood, we summon thence away
    from thee
   The ineffectual poison of the little sharply-stinging gnat.
 [0705604]Thou here who crookest wicked jaws, thou tortuous, jointless,
    limbless thing,
   These jaws thou, Brahmanaspati! shalt bend together like a
    reed.
 [0705605]This scorpion here that creeps along, low on the ground and
    powerless-- [p. a294]
   I have removed his poison and then utterly demolished him.
 [0705606]No strength in thy two arms hast thou, nor in thy head, nor in
    thy waist:
   Then what is that small thing thou so viciously bearest in thy
    tail?
 [0705607]The emmets make a meal of thee and peahens tear and mangle
    thee:
   All ye are crying out, In sooth the scorpion's poison hath no
    strength.
 [0705608]Thou creature who inflictest wounds both with thy mouth and
    with thy tail,
   No poison in thy mouth hast thou: what at thy tail's root will
    there be?

    move together: both, as his possession thrive.

    man.
   Here is the cure of either kind, the chronic and the transient.
 [0707605]We know thine origin, Scrofula! know whence thou, Scrofula,
    art born.

A charm to recover a dying man

[0800101]Homage to Death the Ender! May thy breathings, inward and
    outward, still remain within thee.
   Here stay this man united with his spirit in the Sun's realm, the
    world of life eternal!
 [0800102]Bhaga hath lifted up this man, and Soma with his filaments,
   Indra and Agni, and the Gods the Maruts, raised him up to
    health.
 [0800103]Here is thy spirit, here thy breath, here is thy life, here is thy
    soul:
   By a celestial utterance we raise thee from Destruction's bonds.
 [0800104]Up from this place, O man, rise! sink not downward, casting
    away the bonds of Death that hold thee.
   Be not thou parted from this world, from sight of Agni and the
   Sun.
 [0800105]Purely for thee breathe Wind and Matarisvan, and let the
   Waters rain on thee their nectar.
   The Sun shall shine with healing on thy body; Death shall have
    mercy on thee: do not leave us!
 [0800106]Upward must be thy way, O man, not downward: with life and
    mental vigour I endow thee.
   Ascend this car eternal, lightly rolling; then full of years shalt
    thou address the meeting.
 [0800107]Let not thy soul go thither, nor be lost to us: slight not the
    living, go not where the Fathers are.
   Let all the Gods retain thee here in safety.
 [0800108]Yearn not for the departed ones, for those who lead men far
    away.
   Rise up from darkness into light: come, both thy hands we
    clasp in ours.
 [0800109]Let not the black dog and the brindled seize thee, two warders
    of the way sent forth by Yama.
   Come hither; do not hesitate: with mind averted stay not there. [p. a323]
 [0800110]Forbear to tread this path, for it is awful: that path I speak of
    which thou hast not travelled.
   Enter it not, O man; this way is darkness: forward is danger,
    hitherward is safety.
 [0800111]Thy guardians be the Fires within the Waters, thy guardian be
    the Fire which men enkindle.
   Thy guardian be Vaisvanara Jatavedas; let not celestial Fire with
    lightning burn thee.
 [0800112]Let not the Flesh-Consumer plot against thee: depart thou far
    away from the Destroyer.
   Be Heaven and Earth and Sun and Moon thy keepers, and from
    the dart of Gods may Air protect thee.
 [0800113]May Vigilance and Watchfulness protect thee, Sleepless and
   Slumberless keep guard above thee!
   Let Guardian and let Wakeful be thy warders.
 [0800114]Let these be thy preservers, these thy keepers. All hail to these,
    to these be lowly worship!
 [0800115]May saving Savitar, Vayu, Indra, Dhatar restore thee to com-
    munion with the living.
   Let not thy vigour or thy breath forsake thee: we recall thy life.
 [0800116]Let not the fiend with snapping jaws, nor darkness find thee:
    tongue, holy grass: how shouldst thou perish?
   May the Adityas and the Vasus, Indra and Agni raise thee and
    to health restore thee.
 [0800117]The Sky hath raised thee, and the Earth, Prajapati hath raised
    thee up.
   The Plants and Herbs with Soma as their King have rescued
    thee from Death.
 [0800118]Here let this man, O Gods, remain: let him not go to yonder
    world.
   We rescue him from Mrityu with a charm that hath a thousand
    powers.
 [0800119]I have delivered thee from Death. Strength-givers smelt and
    fashion thee!
   Let not she-fiends with wild loose locks, or fearful howlers yell
    at thee.
 [0800120]I have attained and captured thee: thou hast returned restored
    to youth.
   Perfect in body: so have I found all thy sight and all thy life. [p. a324]
 [0800121]Life hath breathed on thee; light hath come: darkness hath past
    away from thee.
   Far from thee we have buried Death, buried Destruction and:
   Decline.

The same

[0800201]Seize to thyself this trust of life for ever: thine be longevity
    which nothing shortens.
   Thy spirit and thy life again I bring thee: die not, nor vanish
    into mist and darkness.
 [0800202]Come to the light of living men, come hither: I draw thee to a
    life of hundred autumns.
   Loosing the bonds of Death, the curse that holds thee, I give thee
    age of very long duration.
 [0800203]Thy breath have I recovered from the Wind, thy vision from the
   Sun.
   Thy mind I stablish and secure within thee: feel in thy members,.
    use thy tongue, conversing.
 [0800204]I blow upon thee with the breath of bipeds and quadrupeds, as
    on a fire new-kindled.
   To thee, O Death, and to thy sight and breath have I paid
    reverence.
 [0800205]Let this man live, let him not die: we raise him, we recover him.
   I make for him a healing balm. O Death, forbear to slay this
    man. [p. a325]
 [0800206]Here for sound health I invocate a living animating plant,
   Preserving, queller of disease, victorious, full of power and
    might.
 [0800207]Seize him not, but encourage and release him: here let him stay,
    though thine, in all his vigour.
   Bhava and Sarva, pity and protect him: give him full life and
    drive away misfortunes.
 [0800208]Comfort him, Death, and pity him: let him arise and pass away,
   Unharmed, with all his members, hearing well, with old, may he
    through hundred years win profit with his soul.
 [0800209]May the Gods' missile pass thee by. I bring thee safe from the
    mist: from death have I preserved thee.
   Far have I banished flesh-consuming Agni: I place a rampart
    for thy life's protection.
 [0800210]Saving him from that misty path of thine which cannot be
    defined.
   From that descent of thine, O Death, we make for him a shield
    of prayer.
 [0800211]I give thee both the acts of breath, health, lengthened life, and
    death by age.
   All Yama's messengers who roam around, sent by Vaivasvata,
   I chase away.
 [0800212]Far off we drive Malignity, Destruction, Pisachas banqueters on
    flesh, and Grahi.
   And all the demon kind, the brood of sin, like darkness, we
    dispel.
 [0800213]I win thy life from Agni, from the living everlasting Jatavedas.
   This I procure for thee, that thou, undying, mayst not suffer
    harm, that thou mayst be content, that all be well with thee.
 [0800214]Gracious to thee be Heaven and Earth, bringing no grief, and
    drawing nigh!
   Pleasantly shine the Sun for thee, the Wind blow sweetly to
    thy heart!
   Let the celestial Waters full of milk flow happily for thee.
 [0800215]Auspicious be the Plants to thee! I have upraised thee, borne
    thee from the lower to the upper earth:
   Let the two Sons of Aditi, the Sun and Moon, protect thee there.
 [0800216]Whatever robe to cover thee or zone thou makest for thyself,
   We make it pleasant to thy frame: may it be soft and smooth
    to touch. [p. a326]
 [0800217]When, with a very keen and cleasing razor, our hair and beards
    thou shavest as a barber,
   Smoothing our face steal not our vital forces.
 [0800218]Auspicious unto thee be rice and barley, causing no painful sick-
    ness or consumption, these deliver from calamity.
 [0800219]Thy food, thy drink, whate'er they be corn grown by cultivation,
    milk,
   Food eatable, uneatable, I make all poisonless for thee.
 [0800220]We give thee over as a charge to Day and Night, in trust to
    both.
   Keep him for me from stingy fiends, from those who fain would
    feed on him.
 [0800221]A hundred, yea, ten thousand years we give thee, ages two,
    three, four.
   May Indra, Agni, all the Gods, with willing favour look on thee.
 [0800222]To Autumn we deliver thee, to Winter, Spring and Summer's
    care.
   We trust thee with auspicious years wherein the plants and herbs
    grow up.
 [0800223]Death is the lord of bipeds, Death is sovran lord of quadrupeds.
   Away I bear thee from that: Death the ruler: be not thou
    afraid.
 [0800224]Thou, still uninjured, shalt not die: be not afraid; thou shalt
    not die.
   Here where I am men do not die or go to lowest depths of
    gloom.
 [0800225]Here verily all creatures live, the cow, the horse, the man, the
    beast,
   Here where this holy prayer is used, a rampart that protecteth
    life.
   Let it preserve thee from thy peers, from incantation, from thy
    friends.
 [0800226]Live very long, be healthy, be immortal: let not the vital breath
    forsake thy body.
 [0800227]One and a hundred modes of death, dangers that may be over-
    come,
   May Gods deliver thee from this when Agni, dear to all men,
    bids.
 [0800228]Body of Agni prompt to save, slayer of fiends and foes art thou,
   Yea, banisher of malady, the healing balm called Putudru.

HYMN III

  

A prayer for the destruction of demons

[0800301]I balm with oil the mighty demon-slayer, to the most famous
    friend I come for shelter.
   Enkindled, sharpened by our rites, may Agni protect us in the
    day and night from evil.
 [0800302]O Jatavedas, armed with teeth of iron, enkindled with thy flame,
    attack the demons.
   Seize with thy tongue the foolish gods' adorers: rend, put with-
    in thy mouth the raw-flesh-eaters.
 [0800303]Apply thy teeth, the upper and the lower, thou who hast both,
    enkindled and destroying.
   Roam also in the air, O King, around us, and with thy jaws
    assail the wicked spirits.
 [0800304]Pierce through the Yatudhana's skin, O Agni; let the destroying
    dart with fire consume him.
   Rend his joints, Jatavedas! let the eater of raw flesh, seeking
    flesh, tear and destroy him.
 [0800305]Where now thou seest, Agni Jatavedas! a Yatudhana, standing
    still or roaming.
   Or one that flieth through the air's mid-region, kindled to fury
    as an archer pierce him. [p. a328]
 [0800306]Bending thy shafts through sacrifices, Agni! dipping thine
    arrows in the hymn to point them,
   Pierce to the heart therewith the Yatudhanas, and break their
    arms uplifted to attack thee.
 [0800307]Rescue the captives also, Jatavedas! yea, those whom Yatudha-
    nas' spears have captured.
   Strike down that fiend, blazing before him, Agni! Let spotted
    carrion-eating kites devour him.
 [0800308]Here tell this forth, O Agni: whosoever is, he himself, or acteth
    as, a demon,
   Grasp him, O thou most youthful, with thy fuel: to the Man-
   Seer's eye give him as booty.
 [0800309]With keen glance guard the sacrifice, O Agni: thou Sage, con-
    duct it onward to the Vasus.
   Let not the fiends, O Man-Beholder, harm thee burning against
    the Rakshasas to slay them.
 [0800310]Look on the fiend, 'mid men, as Man-Beholder: rend thou his
    three extremities in pieces.
   Demolish with thy flame his ribs, O Agni: the Yatudhana's
    root destroy thou triply.
 [0800311]Thrice, Agni, let thy noose surround the demon who with his
    falsehood injures holy Order.
   Loud roaring with thy flame, Jatavedas, fetter him in the pre-
    sense of the singer.
 [0800312]Agni, what curse the pair this day may utter, what rude rough
    word the worshippers have spoken,
   Each arrowy taunt sped from the angry spirit,--pierce to the
    heart therewith the Yatudhanas.
 [0800313]With fervent heat exterminate the demons: destroy the fiends
    with glow and flame, O Agni.
   Destroy with fire the foolish gods' adorers: destroy the insatiate
    fiercely-burning creatures.
 [0800314]May Gods destroy to-day the evil-doer: may uttered curses turn
    again and strike him.
   Let arrows pierce the liar in his vitals, and Visva's net enclose
    the Yatudhana.
 [0800315]The fiend who smears himself with flesh of cattle, with flesh of
    horses and of human bodies,
   Who steals the milch-cow's milk away, O Agni,--tear off the
    heads of such with fiery fury. [p. a329]
 [0800316]Let the fiends steal the poison of the cattle: may Aditi cast off
    the evil-doers.
   May the God Savitar give them up to ruin, and be their share
    of herbs and plants denied them.
 [0800317]The cow gives milk each year, O Man-Beholder: let not the
   Yatudhana ever taste it.
   Agni, if one should glut him with the biestings, pierce with thy
    flame his vitals as he meets thee.
 [0800318]Agni, from days of old thou slayest demons: never have
   Rakshasas in fight o'ercome thee.
   Burn up the foolish ones, the flesh-devourers: let none of them
    escape thy heavenly arrow.
 [0800319]Guard us, O Agni, from above and under, protect us from be-
    hind and from before us;
   And may thy flames, most fierce and never wasting, glowing
    with fervent heat, consume the sinner.
 [0800320]From rear, from front, from under, from above us, Agni, pro-
    tect us as a sage with wisdom.
   Guard to old age thy friend as friend eternal: O Agni, as im-
    mortal, guard us mortals.
 [0800321]Lend thou the worshipper that eye, O Agni, where with thou
    lookest on the hoof-armed demons.
   With light celestial in Atharvan's manner burn up the fool who
    ruins truth with falsehood.
 [0800322]We set thee round us as a fort, victorious Agni! thee, a sage,
   In conquering colour day by day, destroyer of the treacherous
    foe.
 [0800323]With deadly poison strike thou back the treacherous brood of
   Rakshasas,
   O Agni, with thy sharpened glow, with rays that flash with
    points of flame.
 [0800324]Agni shines far and wide with lofty splendour, and by his great-
    ness makes all things apparent.
   He conquers godless and malign enchantments, and sharpens
    both his horns to gore the ogres.
 [0800325]Thy two unwasting horns, O Jatavedas, keen-pointed weapons,
    sharpened by devotion
   With these transfix the wicked-souled Kimidin, with fierce flame,
   Jatavedas! when he meets thee. [p. a330]
 [0800326]Bright, radiant, meet to be adored, immortal with refulgent
    glow,
   Agni drives Rakshasas away.

HYMN IV

  

Imprecations on demons

[0800401]Indra and Soma, burn, destroy the demon foe! Send downward,
   O ye Bulls, those who add gloom to gloom.
   Annihilate the fools, slay them and burn them up: chase them
    away from us, pierce the voracious fiends. [p. a331]
 [0800402]Let sin, Indra and Soma! round the wicked boil, like as a cald-
    ron set amid the flames of fire.
   Against the foe of prayer, eater of gory flesh, the fearful-eyed
   Kimidin, keep perpetual hate.
 [0800403]Indra and Soma, plunge the wicked in the depth, yea, cast them
    into darkness that hath no support,
   So that not one of them may ever thence return: so may your
    wrathful might prevail and conquer them.
 [0800404]Indra and Soma, hurl your deadly crushing bolt down on the
    wicked fiend from heaven and from the earth.
   Yea, fashion from the big clouds your celestial dart wherewith
    ye burn to death the waxing demon race.
 [0800405]Indra and Soma, cast ye downward from the sky your deadly
    bolts of stone burning with fiery flame,
   Eternal, scorching darts. Plunge the voracious fiends within the
    depth, and let them pass without a sound.
 [0800406]Indra and Soma, let this hymn control you both, even as the
    girth encompasses two vigorous steeds
   The song of praise which I with wisdom offer you. Do ye, as
   Lords of men, animate these my prayers.
 [0800407]In your impetuous manner think ye both thereon: destroy those
    evil spirits, kill the treacherous fiends.
   Indra and Soma, let the wicked have no bliss whoso at any time-
    attacks and injures us.
 [0800408]Whoso accuses me with words of falsehood when I pursue my
    way with guileless spirit,
   May he, the speaker of untruth, be, Indra! like water which the
    hollowed hand compresses.
 [0800409]Those who destroy, as is their wont, the simple, and with their
    evil natures harm the righteous,
   May Soma give them over to the serpent, or to the lap of
   Nirriti consign them.
 [0800410]O Agni, whosoever seeks to injure the essence of our food, kine,
    steeds, or bodies,
   May he, the adversary, thief, and robber, sink to destruction,.
    both himself and offspring.
 [0800411]May he be swept away, himself and children; may all the three
    earths press him down beneath them.
   May his fair glory, O ye Gods, be blighted, who in the day or
    night would fain destroy us. [p. a332]
 [0800412]The prudent finds it easy to distinguish the true and false: their
    words oppose each other.
   Of these two that which is the true and honest Soma protects,
    and brings the false to nothing.
 [0800413]Never doth Soma aid and guide the wicked or him who falsely
    claims the Warrior's title.
   He slays the fiend and him who speaks untruly: both lie entan-
    gled in the noose of Indra.
 [0800414]As if I worshipped deities of falsehood, or thought vain thoughts
    about the Gods, O Agni!
   Why art thou angry with us, Jatavedas? Destruction fall on
    those who lie against thee!
 [0800415]So may I die this day if I have harassed any man's life, or if I
    be a demon.
   Yea, may he lose all his ten sons together who with false tongue
    hath called me Yatudhana.
 [0800416]May Indra slay him with a mighty weapon, and let the vilest of
    all creatures perish,
   The fiend who says that he is pure, who calls me a demon
    though devoid of demon nature.
 [0800417]She too who wanders like an owl at night-time, hiding her body
    in her guile and malice,
   May she fall downward into endless caverns. May press-stones
    with loud ring destroy the demons.
 [0800418]Spread out, ye Maruts, search among the people: seize ye and
    grind the Rakshasas to pieces,
   Who fly abroad, transformed to birds, at night-time, and sully
    and pollute our holy worship.
 [0800419]Hurl down from heaven thy bolt of stone, O Indra: sharpen it,
   Maghavan, made keen by Soma.
   Forward, behind, and from above and under, smite down the
    demons with thy rocky weapon.
 [0800420]They fly, the demon dogs, and, bent on mischief, fain would they
    harm indomitable Indra.
   Sakra makes sharp his weapon for the wicked: now let him
    cast his bolt at fiendish wizards.
 [0800421]Indra hath ever been the fiends' destroyer who spoil oblations of
    the Gods' invokers.
   Yea, Sakra, like an axe that splits the timber, assails and sma-
    shes them like earthen vessels. [p. a333]
 [0800422]Destroy the fiend shaped like an owl or owlet, destroy him in.
    the form of dog or cuckoo.
   Destroy him shaped as eagle or as vulture: as with a stone, O
   Indra, crush the demon.
 [0800423]Let not the fiend of witchcraft-workers reach us: may Dawn.
    drive off the couples of Kimidins.
   Earth keep us safe from earthly woe and trouble! From grief
    that comes from heaven Mid-air preserve us!
 [0800424]Indra destroy the demon, male and female, joying and triumph-
    ing in arts of magic!
   Let the fools' gods with bent necks fall and perish, and see no.
    more the Sun when he arises.
 [0800425]Look, each one, hither, look around. Indra and Soma, watch ye
    well.
   Cast forth your weapon at the fiends: against the sorcerers hurl
    your bolt.

HYMN V

  

A charm accompanying investiture with an amulet

[0800501]Upon the strong is bound the strong, this magic cord, this Amu-
    let,
   Potent, foe-slayer, served by valiant heroes, happy and fortu-
    nate defence.
 [0800502]This Charm, foe-slayer, served by many heroes, strong, power-
    ful, victorious, and mighty, goes bravely forth to meet and
    ruin witchcraft.
 [0800503]With this same Amulet wise Indra routed the Asuras, with this
    he slaughtered Vritra,
   With this he won this pair, both Earth and Heaven, and made
    the sky's four regions his possession.
 [0800504]May this encircling magic cord, this Amulet of Sraktya wood,
   Mighty, subduing enemies, keep us secure on every side.
 [0800505]This Agni hath declared, Soma declared it, Brihaspati, and
   Savitar, and Indra.
   So may these Gods whom I have set before me oppose with
    saving charms and banish witchcraft.
 [0800506]I have obscured the heaven and earth, yea, and the daylight and
    the sun.
   So may these Gods whom I have set before me oppose with
    saving charms and banish witchcraft.
 [0800507]Whoever for his armour takes an amulet of the Sraktya tree,
   Like the Sun risen up to heaven, quells witchcraft with superior
    might.
 [0800508]With Amulet of Sraktya wood, as with a thoughtful Rishi's aid,
   In every fight have I prevailed; I smite the foes and Rakshasas.
 [0800509]All witchcraft of Angirases,"all witchcraft wrought by Asuras,
   All witchcraft self-originate, and all that others have prepared,
   May these depart to both remotest spaces, past ninety ample
    water-floods.
 [0800510]May the Gods bind the Charm on him for armour, Indra, and
   Vishnu, Savitar Rudra, Agni,
   Prajapati, sublimest Parameshlhin, Viraj, Vaisvanara, and all
    the Rishis.
 [0800511]Thou art the chief of all the plants, even as a bull among the
    beasts. [p. a335]
   A tiger of the beasts of prey. Him whom we sought for have we
    found, him lying near in wait for us.
 [0800512]A tiger verily is he, he is a lion, and a bull,
   Subduer of his foes is he, the man who wears this Amulet.
 [0800513]No mortal beings slay him, no Gandharvas, no Apsarases;
   O'er all the regions he is king, the man who wears this Amulet.
 [0800514]Kasyapa formed and fashioned thee, Kasyapa raised and sent
    thee forth.
   Indra wore thee, and, wearing thee, won in the wrestling-match
    with man.
    The Amulet of boundless might the Gods have made a coat of
    mail.
 [0800515]Whoever would destroy thee with Diksha-rites, sacrifices, spells,
   Meet him and smite him, Indra! with thy hundred-knotted
    thunderbolt.
 [0800516]Verily let this Amulet, circular, potent, conquering,
   Happy and fortunate defence, preserve thy children and thy
    wealth.
 [0800517]Brave Indra, set before us light, peace and security from below,
   Peace and security from above, peace and security from behind.
 [0800518]My coat of mail is Heaven and Earth, my coat of mail is Day
    and Sun:
   A coat of mail may Indra and Agni and Dhatar grant to me.
 [0800519]Not all the Gods may pierce, all leagued together, the vast
    strong shield which Indra gives, and Agni.
   May that great shield on all sides guard my body, that to full
    old my life may be extended.
 [0800520]Let the Gods' Charm be bound on me to keep me safe from
    every ill.
   Come ye and enter all within this pillar, the safe-guard of the
    body, thrice-defended.
 [0800521]In this let Indra lay a store of valour: approach ye Gods, and
    enter it together,
   For his long life, to last a hundred autumns, that to full age his
    days may be extended.
 [0800522]Lord of the clan who brings, us bliss, fiend-slayer, queller of the
    foe,
   May he, the conqueror, ne'er subdued, may Indra bind the
   Charm on thee, [p. a336]
   Bull, Soma-drinker, he who gives us peace.
   May he protect thee round about, by night and day on every,
    side.

A charm to exercise evil spirits who beset women

[0800601]Let neither fiend of evil name, Alinsa, Vatsapa, desire
   Thy pair of husband-wooers which thy mother cleansed when,
    thou wast born.
 [0800602]Palala, Anupalala, Sarku, Koka, Malimlucha, Palijaka Vavri-
    vasas and Asresha, Rikshagriva and Pramilin.
 [0800603]Approach not, come not hitherward: creep not thou in-between
    her thighs.
   I set, to guard her, Baja, that which chases him of evil name. [p. a337]
 [0800604]Durnama and Sunama both are eager to converse with her.
   We drive away Arayas: let Sunama seek the women-folk,
 [0800605]The black and hairy Asura, and Stambaja and Tundika,
   Arayas from this girl we drive, from bosom, waist, and parts
    below.
 [0800606]Sniffer, and Feeler, him who eats raw flesh, and him who licks
    his lips,
   Arayas with the tails of dogs, the yellow Baja hath destroyed.
 [0800607]Whoever, in thy brother's shape or father's comes to thee in
    sleep,
   Let Baja rout and chase them like eunuchs with woman's head-
    dress on.
 [0800608]Whoever steals to thee asleep or thinks to harm thee when
    awake,--
   These hath it banished, as the Sun travelling round drives shade
    away.
 [0800609]Whoever causeth her to lose her child or bear untimely fruit,--
   Destroy him, O thou Plant, destroy the slippery fiend who lusts
    for her.
 [0800610]Those who at evening, with the bray of asses, dance around the
    house, Kukshilas, and Kusfilas, and Kakubhas, Srimas,
   Karumas,
   These with thine odour, O thou Plant, drive far away to every
    side.
 [0800611]Kukundhas and Kukurabhas who dress themselves in hides and
    skins,
   Who dance about like eunuchs, who raise a wild clamour in the
    wood, all these we banish far away.
 [0800612]All those who cannot bear the Sun who warms us yonder from
    the sky,
   Arayas with the smell of goats, malodorous, with bloody mouths,
    the Makakas we drive afar.
 [0800613]All those who on their shoulders bear a head of monstrous
    magnitude,
   Who pierce the women's loins with pain,--those demons, Indra
    drive away!
 [0800614]Those, bearing horns upon their hands, who first of all approach
    the brides;
   Standing in ovens, laughing loud, those who in bushes flash forth
    light, all these we banish hence away. [p. a338]
 [0800615]Those who have retroverted toes, and heels and faces in the
    front,
   Khalajas, Sakadhumajas, Urundas, all the Matmatas, impotent
   Kumbhamushkas, these,
   Drive thou, O Brahmanaspati, far from this girl with vigilance.
 [0800616]Sightless and with distorted eyes, impotent. woman less be they.
   O Healing Plant, cast each away who, not her husband, would
    approach this woman wedded to her lord.
 [0800617]The Bristly-haired, the Maniac-haired, the Biter, and the
   Groper-fiend,
   The Creeper-near, the Copper-hued, the Snouty, and the Saluda,
   With foot and heel kick over, as a hasty cow her milking-pan.
 [0800618]If one should touch thy coming babe or kill thine infant newly
    born,
   The yellow Plant with mighty bow shall pierce him even to the
    heart.
 [0800619]Those who kill infants unawares, and near the new-made mothers
    lie,
   Let Pinga chase the amorous Gandharvas as wind chases cloud.
 [0800620]Let it maintain the genial seed: let the laid embryo rest secure.
   Let both strong Healers, to be worn within the girdle, guard the
    babe.
 [0800621]From the Kimidin, for thy lord and children, Pinga shield thee
    well,
   From Sayaka, and Nagnaka, Tangalva, and Pavinasa.
 [0800622]From the five-footed, fingerless, from the four-eyed, the double-
    faced,
   From the Close-creeper, from the Worm, from the Quick-roller
    guard her well.
 [0800623]Those who eat flesh uncooked, and those who eat the bleeding
    flesh of men,
   Feeders on babes unborn, long-haired, far from this place we
    banish these.
 [0800624]Shy slinkers from the Sun, as slinks a woman from her husband's
    sire,
   Deep down into the heart of these let Baja and let Pinga pierce.
 [0800625]Pinga, preserve the babe at birth, make not the boy a female
    child.
   Let not Egg-eaters mar the germs: drive the Kimidins far away. [p. a339]
 [0800626]Sterility, and infants' death, and weeping that announceth
    woe,
   Dear! lay them on the fiend as thou wouldst pluck a garland
    from a tree.

A charm to restore a sick man to health

[0800701]The tawny-coloured, and the pale, the variegated and the red,
   The dusky-tinted, and the black,--all Plants we summon hither-
    ward.
 [0800702]This man let them deliver from Consumption which the Gods
    have sent.
   The father of these Herbs was Heaven, their mother Earth, the
   Sea their root.
 [0800703]The Waters are the best, and heavenly Plants.
   From every limb of thine have they removed Consumption
    caused by sin.
 [0800704]I speak to Healing Herbs spreading, and bushy, to creepers, and
    to those whose sheath is single,
   I call for thee the fibrous and the reed-like, and branching.
   Plants, dear to the Visve Devas, powerful, giving life to men.
 [0800705]The conquering strength, the power and might which ye, victo-
    rious Plants, possess,
   Therewith deliver this man here from this Consumption, O ye
   Plants: so I prepare the remedy.
 [0800706]The living Plant that giveth life, that driveth malady away,
   Arundhatr, the rescuer, strengthening, rich a sweets I call, to free
    this man from scath and harm.
 [0800707]Hitherward let the sapient come, the friendly sharers o f my
    speech. [p. a341]
   That we may give this man relief and raise him from his evil
    plight.
 [0800708]Germ of the Waters, Agni's food, Plants ever growing fresh and
    new,
   Sure, healing, bearing thousand names, let them be all collected
    here.
 [0800709]Let Plants whose soul is water, girt with Avakas, piercing with
    their sharp horns expel the malady.
 [0800710]Strong, antidotes of poison, those releasers, free from Varuna,
   And those that drive away Catarrh, and those that frustrate
    magic arts, let all those Plants come hitherward.
 [0800711]Let purchased Plants of mightier power, Plants that are praised
    for excellence.
   Here in this village safely keep cattle and horses, man and beast.
 [0800712]Sweet is their root, sweet are these Plants' top branches, sweet
    also is their intermediate portion;
   Sweet is their foliage, and sweet their blossom, combined with
    sweetness is their taste of Amrit: food, fatness let them yield,
    with kine preceding.
 [0800713]These Plants that grow upon the earth, whate'er their number
    and their size,
   Let these with all their thousand leaves free me from Death and
    misery.
 [0800714]May the Plants' Tiger-amulet, protective, guardian from the
    curse,
   Beat off the brood of demons, drive all maladies afar from us.
 [0800715]Before the gathered Plants they fly and scatter, as though a lion's
    roar or fire dismayed them.
   Expelled by Plants, let men's and kine's Consumption pass from
    us to the navigable rivers.
 [0800716]Emancipated from the sway of Agni, of Vaisvanara, go, covering
    the earth, ye Plants whose ruler is Vanaspati.
 [0800717]May these be pleasant to our heart, auspicious, rich in store of
    milk,
   These Plants of the Angirases which grow on mountains and on
    plains.
 [0800718]The Plants I know myself, the plants that with mine eye I look
    upon,
   Plants yet unknown, and those we know, wherein we find that
    power is stored, [p. a342]
 [0800719]Let all the congregated Plants attend and mark mine utterance,
   That we may rescue this man here and save him from severe
    distress.
 [0800720]Asvattha, Darbha, King of Plants, is Soma, deathless sacrifice
   Barley and Rice are healing balms, the sons of Heaven who
    never die.
 [0800721]Lift yourselves up, ye Healing Plants, loud is the thunder's crash
    and roar.
   When with full flow Parjanya, ye Children of Prisni! blesseth;
    you.
 [0800722]We give the essence of that stream of nectar of this man to
    drink:
   So I prepare a remedy that he may live a hundred years.
 [0800723]Well doth the wild boar know a Plant, the mungoose knows the
   Healing Herb.
   I call, to aid this man, the Plants which Serpents and Gandhar-
    vas know.
 [0800724]Plants of Angirases which hawks, celestial Plants which eagles.
    know;
   Plants known to swans and lesser fowl, Plants known to all the
    birds that fly.
   Plants that are known to sylvan beasts,--I call them all to aid
    this man.
 [0800725]The multitude of herbs whereon the Cows whom none may
    slaughter feed, all that are food for goats and sheep,
   So many Plants, brought hitherward, give shelter and defence to
    thee!
 [0800726]Hitherward unto thee I bring the Plants that cure all maladies,
   All Plants wherein physicians have discovered health-bestowing
    power.
 [0800727]Let Plants with flower and Plants with bud, the fruitful and the
    fruitless, all,
   Like children of one mother, yield their stores for this man's
    perfeet health.
 [0800728]From the Five-arrowed, from the Ten-arrowed have I delivered
    thee,
   Freed thee from Yama's fetter and from all offence against the
   Gods,

HYMN VIII

  

Imprecations directed against a hostile army

[0800801]Indra the Shaker shake them up, brave, hero, fortdemolisher,
   That into thousand fragments we may strike the armies of our
    foes!
 [0800802]Let Putirajju with her breath corrupt and putrefy that host,
   And terror smite our foemen's heart when fire and smoke are
    seen afar.
 [0800803]Asvattha, rend those men; do thou devour them quickly,
   Khadira!
   Like reeds let them be broken through, down-smitten by a lifted
    rush.
 [0800804]Let Parushahva make them reeds, and let the bulrush strike
    them down:
   Bound in a mighty net let them break quickly like an arrow's
    shaft.
 [0800805]Air was the net; the poles thereof were the great quarters of the
    sky: [p. a344]
   Sakra therewith enveloped and cast on the ground the Dasyus'
    host.
 [0800806]Verily mighty is the net of mighty Sakra rich in wealth:
   Therewith press all the foemen down so that not one of them
    escape!
 [0800807]Great is thy net, brave Indra, thine the mighty match for a
    thousand, Lord of Hundred Powers!
   Holding them, with his host, therewith hath Indra slaughtered
   Dasyus a hundred, thousand, myriad, hundred millions.
 [0800808]This world so mighty was the net of Sakra, of the Mighty One:
   With this, the net of Indra, I envelop all those men with gloom.
 [0800809]Great weakness and misfortune, pain which words can never
    charm away,
   Languor, fatigue, bewilderment, with these I compass all the
    foes.
 [0800810]I give those foemen up to Death: bound in the bonds of Death
    are they.
   I bind and carry them away to meet Death's wicked messengers.
 [0800811]Bear them away, Death's messengers! envoys of Yama! bind
    them fast.
   More than a thousand be their slain: the club of Bhava pierce
    them through!
 [0800812]Forth go the Sadhyas in their might bearing one netpole raised
    aloft.
   One pole the Rudras carry, one the Vasus, and the Adityas one.
 [0800813]The Visve Devas from above shall come depressing it with
    might,
   And in the midst the Angirases, slaying the mighty host, shall go.
 [0800814]Trees of the forest, trees that bear flower and fruit, and herbs
    and plants,
   Quadruped, biped send I forth that they may strike this army
    dead,
 [0800815]Gandharvas, and Apsarases, Gods, Serpents, Fathers, Holy
   Men,
   Seen and unseen, I send them forth that they may strike this
    army dead.
 [0800816]Here spread are snares of Death wherefrom thou, once within
    them, ne'er art freed:
   Full many a thousand of the host yonder this horn shall smite
    and slay. [p. a345]
 [0800817]The Gharma hath been warmed with fire: this Homa slays a
    thousand men.
   Let Bhava, Prisnibahu, and Sarva destroy that armament.
 [0800818]Their portion be the fire of Death, hunger, exhaustion, slaughter,
    fear.
   With your entangling snares and nets, Sarva and Indra! slay that
    host.
 [0800819]Fly, conquered, in alarm, ye foes, run driven by the spell away!
   Let not one man escape of those when routed by Brihaspati.
 [0800820]Down fall their weapons on the ground: no strength be theirs
    to point a shaft:
   Then in their dreadful terror let their arrows wound their vital
    parts.
 [0800821]Let Heaven and Earth roar out in wrath against them, and Air
    with all the Deities in concert,
   Let them not find a surety or a refuge, but torn away go down
    to Death together.
 [0800822]The mules of the Gods' car are heaven's four quarters; their
    hooves are sacred cakes, the air its body.
   Its sides are Heaven and Earth, its reins the Seasons, Voice is its
    hood, its grooms are sky's mid-regions.
 [0800823]Year is the car, Full Year the seat for driving, Viraj the pole,
    the chariot's front is Agni, Indra the warrior, and the Moon
    the driver.
 [0800824]Hence conquer, conquer, Hail! be thou the victor! Let these be
    conquerors and those be conquered.
   Good luck to these, ill luck to those men yonder! With the
    dark-blue-and-red our foes I cover.

HYMN IX

  

An enunciation of cosmogonical, ritual, and metrical doctrine

[0800901]Whence were these two produced? which was that region?'
   From what world, from which earth had they their being?
   Calves of Viraj, these two arose from water. I ask thee of these
    twain, who was their milker.
 [0800902]He who prepared a threefold home, and lying there made the
    water bellow through his greatness,
   Calf of Viraj, giving each wish fulfilment, made bodies for him-
    self far off, in secret.
 [0800903]Which are the three, the mighty three, whereof the fourth divides
    the voice,
   This may the Brahman know by prayer and fervour, whereto
    belongs the one, whereto the other.
 [0800904]Out of the Brihat as the sixth five Salmons have been fashioned
    forth:
   From Brihati was Brihat formed: whence was the Brihati com-
    posed?
 [0800905]On measure Brihati is based, and measure on the measurer:
   From magic might came magic might, from magic might came
   Matali.
 [0800906]Vaisvanara's image is the sky above us, so far as Agni forced
    both spheres asunder. [p. a347]
   Thence from that region as the sixth come praise-songs, and
    every sixth day hence again go upward.
 [0800907]We, Kagyapa! six present Rishis, ask thee--for thou hast prov-
    ed things tried and meet for trial
   They call Viraj the Father of Devotion: tell her to us thy
    friends in all her figures.
 [0800908]She whom, advancing, sacrifices follow, and when she takes her
    station stand beside her,
   By whose control and hest the spirit moveth, she is Viraj, in
    highest heaven, O Rishis.
 [0800909]Breathless, she moves by breath of living creatures, Svaraj pre-
    cedes, Viraj comes closely after.
   Some men behold her not, and some behold her, Viraj meet-
    shaped, who thinks of all existence.
 [0800910]Who hath perceived Viraj's duplication, perceived her seasons
    and her rule and practice?
   Who knows her steps, how oft, how far extended, who knows
    her home and number of her dawnings?
 [0800911]She here who first of all sent forth her lustre moves onward
    resting on these lower creatures.
   Exalted power and might are stored within her: the woman
    hath prevailed, the new-come mother.
 [0800912]Both Dawns on wings of song, with rich adornment, move on
    together to their common dwelling.
   Surya's two wives, unwasting, most prolific, knowing their way,
    move, rich in light, together.
 [0800913]The three have passed along the path of Order--three warm
    libations have regarded offspring
   One quickens progeny, one strengthens vigour, and one protects
    the kingdom of the pious.
 [0800914]She who was fourth was made by Agni, Soma, and Rishis as.
    they formed both halves of worship,
   Gayatri, Trishtup, Jagati, Anushtup, Brihadarki lightening the
    sacrificer.
 [0800915]Five milkings answer to the fivefold dawning, five seasons to
    the cow who bears five titles.
   The five sky-regions made fifteen in number, one head have
    these to one sole world directed.
 [0800916]Six Elements arose, first-born of Order: the six-day time is
    carried by six Samans. [p. a348]
   Six-yoked the plough is, as each trace is numbered: they call
    both broad ones six; six, Earth and Heaven.
 [0800917]They call the cold months six, and six the hot ones. Which, tell
    us, of the seasons is redundant?
   Seven sages, eagles, have sat down together: seven metres
    match the seven Consecrations.
 [0800918]Seven are the Homas, seven the logs for burning, seven are the
    streams of mead, and seven the seasons.
   Into the world have come seven streams of butter; those we
    have heard of as the Seven Vultures.
 [0800919]Seven metres, by four syllables increasing, each of the seven
    founded upon another
   How are the hymns of praise on these supported, and how are
    these imposed upon the praise-songs?
 [0800920]How hath the Gayatri filled out three triads? On the fifteen
    how is the Trishtup moulded,
   Jagati fashioned on the three-and-thirty? How is Anushtup
    formed? how Ekavinsa?
 [0800921]Eight Elements sprang up, first born of Order: the Priests
    divine are eight in number, Indra!
   Eight are the wombs of Aditi, eight her children; for the eighth
    night is the libation destined.
 [0800922]So planning bliss for you have I come hither to win your
    friendship: kind am I, and gracious.
   Born from one source, propitious is your wisdom: knowing
    full well to all of you it cometh.
 [0800923]To Indra eight, to Yama six, seven to the Rishis, seven to
    each:
   The number five accompanies waters and men and healing
    herbs.
 [0800924]The Heifer, all his own, poured forth for Indra control and
    milk at her first time of milking;
   And he then satisfied the four divisions, the Gods and men and
   Asuras and Rishis.
 [0800925]Who is the Cow? Who is the Single Rishi? What is the law,
    what are the benedictions?
   What on the earth is the one only Spirit? Which of the number
    is the Single Season?
 [0800926]One is the Cow, one is the Single Spirit, one is the law, single
    are benedictions. [p. a349]
   The Spirit dwelling on the earth is single: the Single Season
    never is transcended.

HYMN X

  

A glorification of the mystical abstraction Viraj

[0801001]Viraj at first was This. At birth all feared her; the thought, She
    will become this All, struck terror.
 [0801002]She rose, the Garhapatya fire she entered. He who knows this
    becomes lord of a household, performer of domestic sacri-
    fices.
 [0801003]She mounted up, the Eastward fire she entered. He who knows
    this becomes the Gods' beloved, and to his call they come
    when she invokes them.
 [0801004]She mounted up, the Southward fire she entered.
   He who knows this becomes a fit performer of sacrifice, meet
    for honour, shelter-giver.
 [0801005]She mounted up, she entered the Assembly. He who knows this
    becomes polite and courtly, and people come as guests to his
    assembly.
 [0801006]She mounted up, she passed within the meeting. He who knows
    this becomes fit for the meeting, and to his hall of meeting
    come the people. [p. a351]
 [0801007]She mounted up, she entered Consultation. Whoso knows this
    is fit to be consulted, and to his consultation come the
    people.
 [0801008]She mounted up, and, into four divided, she took her station in
    the air's mid-region.
 [0801009]Of her the Gods and men said, This she knoweth. That we may
    both have life let us invoke her.
 [0801010]Thus did they cry to her:
 [0801011]Come, Strength! come, Food! come, Charmer! come, Free-
    giver!
 [0801012]Her calf, her well-beloved calf, was Indra: Gayatri was her
    rope, the cloud her udder.
 [0801013]Two teats she had, Rathantara and Brihat, two, Yajnayajniya
    and Vamadevya.
 [0801014]With the Rathantara the Gods milked from her the Plants, and
    all the wide expanse with Brihat.
 [0801015]They drew the Waters forth with Vamadevya, with Yajnayaj-
    niya they milked out worship.
 [0801016]For him who knoweth this, Rathantara poureth out Plants,
    and Brihat yieldeth wide expansion.
 [0801017]Waters from Vamdevya come, from Yajnayajniya sacrifice.
 [0801018]She rose, she came unto the tress: they killed her. A year went
    by and she again existed.
   Hence in a year the wounds of trees heal over. He who knows
    this sees his loathed rival wounded.
 [0801019]She mounted up, she came unto the Fathers: they killed her:
    in a month she re-existed.
   Hence men give monthly offerings to the Fathers: who knows
    this, knows the path which they have trodden.
 [0801020]She rose, she came unto the Gods: they killed her: but in a
    fortnight she again was living.
   Fortnightly, hence, men serve the Gods with Vasat! Who
    knows this knows the way which Gods pass over.
 [0801021]She mounted up, she came to men: they killed her Presently
    she regained her life and being.
   Hence on both days to men they bring and offer--who knows
    this--near-seated in the dwelling.
 [0801022]She rose, approached the Asuras: they called her: their cry was,
   Come, O Maya, come thou hither. [p. a352]
   Her dear calf was Virochana Prahradi: her milking vessel was a.
    pan of iron.
   Dvimurdha Artvya milked her, yea, this Maya, The Asuras
    depend for life on Maya. He who knows this becomes a fit
    supporter.
 [0801023]She mounted up, she came unto the Fathers. The Fathers called.
    to her, O Food, come hither.
   King Yama was her calf, her pail was silvern. Antaka, Mrityu's.
    son, milked her, this Svadha.
   This Food the Fathers make their lives' sustainer. He who*
    knows this becomes a meet supporter.
 [0801024]She mounted up, she came to men. They called her, Come unto-
    us, come hither thou Free-giver!
   Earth was her milking-pail, the calf beside her Manu Vaivasvata,
   Vivasvan's offspring.
   Prithi the son of Vena was her milker: he milked forth hus-
    bandry and grain for sowing.
   These men depend for life on corn and tillage. He who knows
    this becomes a meet supporter, successful in the culture of his_
    corn-land.
 [0801025]She rose, she came unto the Seven Rishis. They called her,.
   Come, Rich in Devotion! hither.
   King Soma was her calf. the Moon her milk-pail. Brihaspati.
   Angirasa, her milker,
   Drew from her udder Prayer and Holy Fervour. Fervour and
   Prayer maintain the Seven Rishis.
   He who knows this becomes a meet supporter, a priest illustri-
    ous for his sacred knowledge.
 [0801026]She rose, she came unto the Gods. They called her, crying, O
   Vigour, come to us, come hither!
   God Savitar milked her, he milked forth Vigour. The Gods
    depend for life upon that Vigour. He who knows this becomes
    a meet supporter.
 [0801027]She rose approached the Apsarases and Gandharvas. They called
    her, Come to us, O Fragrant-scented!
   The son of Suryavarchas, Chitraratha, was her dear calf, her pail.
    a lotus-petal.
   The son of Suryavarchas, Vasuruchi, milked and drew from her
    most delightful fragrance.
   That scent supports Apsarases and Gandharvas. He who knows [p. a353]
    this becomes a meet supporter, and round him ever breathes
    delicious odour.
 [0801028]She mounted up, she came to Other People. They called her,
    crying, Come, Concealment! hither.
   Her dear calf was Vaisravana Kubera, a vessel never tempered
    was her milk-pail.
   Rajatanabhi, offspring of Kubera, milked her, and from her
    udder drew concealment.
   By that concealment live the Other People. He who knows this
    becomes a meet supporter, and makes all evil disappear and
    vanish.
 [0801029]She mounted up, she came unto the Serpents. The Serpents
    called her, Venomous! come hither.
   Her calf was Takshaka, Visala's offspring: a bottlegourd suppli-
    ed a milking-vessel.
   Iravan's offspring, Dhritarashtra milked her, and from her udder
    drew forth only poison.
   That poison quickens and supports the Serpents: He who knows
    this becomes a meet supporter.
 [0801030]One would ward off, for him who hath this knowledge, if with a
    bottle-gourd he sprinkled water.
 [0801031]And did he not repel, if in his spirit he said, I drive thee back,
    he would repel it.
 [0801032]The poison that it drives away, that poison verily repels.
 [0801033]The man who hath this knowledge pours its venom on his hated
    foe.

BOOK IX

  

HYMN I

  

A glorification of the Asvins' whip and a prayer for blessings

[0900101]The Asvins' Honey-whip was born from heaven and earth, from
    middle air, and ocean, and from fire and wind.
   All living creatures welcome it with joyful hearts, fraught with
    the store of Amrit it hath gathered up.
 [0900102]They call thee earth's great strength in every form, they call
    thee too the ocean's genial seed.
   Whence comes the Honey-whip bestowing bounty, there Vital
   Spirit is, and Amrit treasured.
 [0900103]In sundry spots, repeatedly reflecting, men view upon the earth:
    her course and action;
   For she, the first-born daughter of the Maruts, derives her
    origin from Wind and Agni.
 [0900104]Daughter of Vasus, mother of Adityas, centre of Amrit breath
    of living creatures.
   The Honey-whip, gold-coloured, dropping fatness, moves as a
    mighty embryo 'mid mortals.
 [0900105]The deities begat the Whip of Honey: her embryo assumed all
    forms and fashions.
   The mother nourishes that tender infant which at its birth
    looks on all worlds and beings.
 [0900106]Who understandeth well, who hath perceived it, her heart's un-
    injured Soma-holding beaker?
   Let the wise Brahman priest therein be joyful.
 [0900107]He understandeth them, he hath perceived them, her breasts
    that pour a thousand streams, uninjured.
   They unreluctantly yield strength and vigour.
 [0900108]She who with voice upraised in constant clamour, mighty, life-
    giving, goes unto her function,
   Bellowing to the heated three libations, suckles with streams of
    milk, and still is lowing. [p. a357]
 [0900109]On whom, well-fed, the Waters wait in worship, and steers and
    self-refulgent bulls attend her.
   For thee, for one like thee down pour the Waters, and cause
    desire and strength to rain upon thee.
 [0900110]The thunder is thy voice, O Lord of Creatures: a Bull, thou
    castest on the earth thy vigour.
   The Honey-whip, the Manus' first-born daughter, derives her
    origin from Wind and Agni.
 [0900111]As at the morning sacrifice the Asvins twain love Soma well,
   Even so may both the Asvins lay splendour and strength within
    my soul.
 [0900112]As at the second sacrifice Indra and Agni love him well,
   Let the pair, Indra Agni, lay splendour and strength within my
    soul.
 [0900113]As at third sacrifice Soma is the Ribhus' well-beloved one,
   Even so may they, the Ribhus, store splendour and strength
    within my soul.
 [0900114]Fain would I bring forth sweetness, fain would make it mine.
   Bringing milk, Agni! have I come: splendour and strength
    bestow on me!
 [0900115]Grant me, O Agni, splendid strength, and progeny, and length-
    ened life.
   May the Gods know me as I am, may Indra with the Rishis
    know.
 [0900116]As honey-bees collect and add fresh honey to their honey store,
   Even so may both the Asvins lay splendour and strength within
    my soul.
 [0900117]As over honey flies besmear this honey which the bees have
    made,
   So may both Asvins lay in me splendour and strength and
    power and might.
 [0900118]May all the sweetness that is found in hills and mountains,
    steeds and kine,
   And wine that floweth from the cup,--may all that sweetness
    be in me.
 [0900119]May both the Asvins, Lords of Light, balm me with honey of
    the bees,
   That I may speak among the folk words full of splendour and
    of strength. [p. a358]
 [0900120]The thunder is thy voice, O Lord of Creatures: a Bull, thou
    castest strength on earth and heaven.
   To that all cattle look for their existence: with this she nourishes
    their force and vigour.
 [0900121]The Whip itself is Heaven, Earth is the handle, the point of
    juncture is the Air's mid-region.
   The lash is lightning, and the tip is golden.
 [0900122]Whoever knows the Whip's seven kinds of honey, becomes
    himself a man endowed with sweetness.
   Brahman and King, the draught-ox and the milch-cow, barley
    and rice, and honey is the seventh.
 [0900123]Sweet is the man, sweet are his goods and chattels: he who
    knows this conquers the worlds of sweetness.
 [0900124]The thundering of Prajapati in heaven is verily manifest to living
    creatures.
   Therefore I stand from right to left invested, and, O Prajapati,
   I cry, regard me!
   The man who hath this knowledge is regarded by living beings
    and the Lord of Creatures.

HYMN II

  

A glorification of Kama as God of desire of all that is good

[0900201]Kama the Bull, slayer of foes, I worship with molten butter,
    sacrifice, oblation.
   Beneath my feet cast down mine adversaries with thy great
    manly power, when I have praised thee.
 [0900202]That which is hateful to mine eye and spirit, that harasses and
    robs me of enjoyment,
   The evil dream I loose upon my foemen. May I rend him when
   I have lauded Kama.
 [0900203]Kama, do thou, a mighty Lord and Ruler, let loose ill dream,
    misfortune, want of children,
   Homelessness, Kama! utter destitution, upon the sinner who
    designs my ruin.
 [0900204]Drive them away, drive them afar, O Kama; indigence fall on
    those who are my foemen!
   When they have been cast down to deepest darkness, consume
    their dwellings with thy fire, O Agni.
 [0900205]She, Kama! she is called the Cow, thy daughter, she who is
    named Vak and Viraj by sages.
   By her drive thou my foemen to a distance. May cattle, vital
    breath, and life forsake them.
 [0900206]By Kama's might, King Varuna's and Indra's, by Vishnu's
    strength, and Savitar's instigation,
   I chase my foes with sacrifice to Agni, as a deft steersman drives
    his boat through waters.
 [0900207]May Kama, mighty one, my potent warder, give me full free-
    dom from mine adversaries.
   May all the Deities be my protection, all Gods come nigh to
    this mine invocation.
 [0900208]Accepting this oblation rich with fatness, be joyful here, ye
   Gods whose chief is Kama,
   Giving me freedom from mine adversaries.
 [0900209]Ye, Indra, Agni, Kama! come together and cast mine adver-
    saries down beneath me.
   When they have sunk into the deepest darkness, O Agni, with
    thy fire consume their dwellings. [p. a360]
 [0900210]Slay those who are mine enemies, O Kama: headlong to depth
    of blinding darkness hurl them.
   Reft be they all of manly strength and vigour! Let them not
    have a single day's existence.
 [0900211]Kama hath slain those who were mine opponents, and given me
    ample room to grow and prosper.
   Let the four regions bow them down before me, and let the
    six expanses bring me fatness.
 [0900212]Let them drift downward like a boat torn from the rope that
    held it fast.
   There is no turning back for those whom our keen arrows have
    repelled.
 [0900213]Agni averts, Indra averts, and Soma: may the averting Gods
    avert this foeman.
 [0900214]To be avoided by his friends, detested, repelled, with few men
    round him, let him wander.
   Yea, on the earth descend the lightning-flashes: may the strong
   God destroy your adversaries.
 [0900215]This potent lightning nourishes things shaken, and things un-
    shaken yet, and all the thunders.
   May the Sun, rising with his wealth and splendour, drive in
    victorious might my foemen downward.
 [0900216]Thy firm and triply-barred protection, Kama! thy spell, made
    weapon-proof extended armour
   With that drive thou my foemen to a distance. May cattle, vital
    breath, and life forsake them.
 [0900217]Far from the world wherein we live, O Kama, drive thou my
    foemen with that selfsame weapon
   Wherewith the Gods repelled the fiends, and Indra cast down
    the Dasyus into deepest darkness.
 [0900218]As Gods repelled the Asuras, and Indra down to the lowest
    darkness drove the demons,
   So, Kama, from this world, to distant places, drive thou the
    men who are mine adversaries.
 [0900219]First before all sprang Kama into being. Gods, Fathers, mortal
    men have never matched him.
   Stronger than these art thou, and great for ever. Kama, to thee,
    to thee I offer worship.
 [0900220]Wide as the space which heaven and earth encompass, far as
    the flow of waters, far as Agni, [p. a361]
   Stronger than these art thou, and great for ever. Kama, to thee,
    to thee I offer worship.
 [0900221]Vast as the quarters of the sky and regions that lie between
    them spread in all directions, vast as celestial tracts and views
    of heaven,
   Stronger than these art thou, and great for ever. Kama, to thee,
    to thee I offer worship.
 [0900222]Many as are the bees, and bats, and reptiles, and female serpents
    of the trees, and beetles,
   Stronger art thou than these, and great for ever. Kama, to thee,
    to thee I offer worship.
 [0900223]Stronger art thou than aught that stands or twinkles, stronger
    art thou than ocean, Kama! Manyu!
   Stronger than these art thou, and great for ever. Kama, to thee,
    to thee I offer worship.
  [0900224]Not even Vata is the peer of Kama, not Agni, Chandramas
    the Moon, nor Surya.
   Stronger than these art thou, and great for ever. Kama, to thee,
    to thee I offer worship.
 [0900225]Thy lovely and auspicious forms, O Kama, whereby the thing
    thou wilt becometh real,
   With these come thou and make thy home among us, and make
    malignant thoughts inhabit elsewhere.

HYMN III

  

On the consecration of a newly built house

[0900301]We loose the ties and fastenings of the house that holds all
    precious things,
   The bands of pillars and of stays, the ties of beams that form
    the roof.
 [0900302]All-wealthy House! each knot and band, each cord that is
    attached to thee
   I with my spell untie, as erst Brihaspati disclosed the cave.
 [0900303]He drew them close, he pressed them fast, he made thy knotted.
    bands secure:
   With Indra's help we loose them as a skilful Slaughterer severs
    joints.
 [0900304]We loose the bands of thy bamboos, of bolts, of fastening, of
    thatch,
   We loose the ties of thy side-posts, O House that holdest all we
    prize.
 [0900305]We loosen here the ties and bands of straw in bundles, and of
    clamps,
   Of all that compasses and binds the Lady Genius of the Home.
 [0900306]We loose the loops which men have bound within thee, loops
    to tie and hold.
   Be gracious, when erected, to our bodies, Lady of the Home.
 [0900307]Store-house of Soma, Agni's hall, the ladies' bower, the resi-
    dence,
   The seat of Gods art thou, O Goddess House. [p. a363]
 [0900308]We with our incantation loose the net that hath a thousand.
    eyes.
   The diadem, securely tied and laid upon the central beam.
 [0900309]The man who takes thee as his own, and he who was thy builder,.
   House!
   Both these, O Lady of the Home, shall live to long-extended'
    years.
 [0900310]There let her come to meet this man. Firm, strongly fastened,.
    and prepared
   Art thou whose several limbs and joints we part and loosen one
    by one.
 [0900311]He who collected timber for the work and built thee up, O
   House,
   Made thee for coming progeny, Prajapati, the Lord Supreme.
 [0900312]Homage to him! We worship too the giver and the Mansion's
    lord:
   Homage to Agni! to the man who serves at holy rites for thee.
 [0900313]Homage to kine and steeds! to all that shall be born within the
    house
   We loose the bonds that fasten thee, mother of multitudes to
    come!
 [0900314]Agni thou shelterest within, and people with domestic beasts.
   We loose the bonds that fasten thee, mother of multitudes to
    come!
 [0900315]All space that lies between the earth and heaven, therewith I
    take this house for thy possession,
   And all that measures out the air's mid-region I make a hollow
    to contain thy treasures. Therewith I take the house for his
    possession.
 [0900316]Rich in prosperity, rich in milk, founded and built upon the
    earth,
   Injure not thy receivers, House who holdest food of every sort!'
 [0900317]Grass-covered, clad with straw, the house, like Night, gives rest
    to man and beast.
   Thou standest, built upon the earth, like a she-elephant, borne
    on feet.
 [0900318]I loosen and remove from thee thy covering formed by mats of
    reed.
   What Varuna hath firmly closed Mitra shall ope at early morn. [p. a364]
 [0900319]May Indra, Agni, deathless Gods, protect the house where
   Soma dwells,
   House that was founded with the prayer, built and erected by
    the wise.
 [0900320]Nest upon nest hath been imposed, compartment on compart-
    ment laid:
   There man shall propagate his kind, and there shall everything
    born.
 [0900321]Within the house constructed with two side-posts, or with four,
    or six.
   Built with eight side-posts, or with ten, lies Agni like a babe
    unborn.
 [0900322]Turned to thee, House! I come to thee, innocent, turned to
    welcome me:
   For Fire and Water are within, the first chief door of sacrifice.
 [0900323]Water that kills Consumption, free from all Consumption, here
   I bring.
   With Agni, the immortal one, I enter and possess the house.
 [0900324]Lay thou no cord or noose on us: a weighty burthen, still be
    light!
   Withersoever be our will, O House, we bear thee like a bride.
 [0900325]Now from the east side of the house to the Great Power be
    homage paid!
   Hail to the Gods whose due is Hail!
 [0900326]Now from the south side of the house, etc.
 [0900327]Now from the west side of the house, etc.
 [0900328]Now from the north side of the house, etc.
 [0900329]So from the mansion's every side to the Great Power be homage
    paid!
   Hail to the Gods whose due is Hail!

HYMN IV

  

A glorification of the typical sacrificial bull

[0900401]The Bull, fierce, thousandfold, filled full of vigour, bearing
    within his flanks all forms and natures,
   Brihaspati's Steer, hath stretched the thread, bestowing bliss on
    the worshipper, the liberal giver.
 [0900402]He who at first became the Waters' model, a match for everyone,
    like Earth the Goddess;
   The husband of the cows, the young calves' father, may be
    secure us thousandfold abundance.
 [0900403]Masculine, pregnant, stedfast. full of vigour, the Bull sustains a
    trunk of goodly treasure.
   May Agni Jatavedas bear him offered, on pathways traversed by
    the Gods, to Indra. [p. a366]
 [0900404]The husband of the cows, the young calves' father, father is he
    of mighty water-eddies.
   Calf, after-birth, new milk drawn hot, and biestings, curds, butter,
    that is his best genial humour.
 [0900405]He is the Gods' allotted share and bundle, essence of waters,
    and of plants, and butter.
   Sakra elected him, the draught of Soma. What was his body
    was a lofty mountain.
 [0900400]6. A beaker filled with Soma juice thou bearest. framer of forms,
    begetter of the cattle.
   Kindly to us be these thy wombs here present, and stay for us,
   O Axe, those that are yonder.
 [0900407]He bears oblation, and his seed is butter. Thousand-fold plenty;
    sacrifice they call him.
   May he, the Bull, wearing the shape of Indra, come unto us, O
   Gods, bestowed, with blessing.
 [0900408]Both arms of Varuna, and Indra's vigour, the Maruts' hump is
    he, the Asvins' shoulders.
   They who are sages, bards endowed with wisdom, call him
   Brihaspati compact and heightened.
 [0900409]Thou, vigorous, reachest to the tribes of heaven. Thee they call
   Indra, thee they call Sarasvan.
   Turned to one aim, that Brahman gives a thousand who offers
    up the Bull as his oblation.
 [0900410]Brihaspati, Savitar gave thee vital vigour: thy breath was
    brought from Tvashtar and from Vayu.
   In thought I offer thee in air's mid-region. Thy sacrificial grass
    be Earth and Heaven!
 [0900411]Let the priest joyfully extol the limbs and members of the Bull
   Who moved and roared among the kine as Indra moves among
    the Gods.
 [0900412]The sides must be Anumati's, and both rib-pieces Bhaga's share,
   Of the knee-bones hath Mitra said, Both these are mine, and
    only mine.
 [0900413]The Adityas claim the hinder parts, the loins must be Brihas-
    pati's.
   Vata, the God, receives the tail: he stirs the plants and herbs
    therewith,
 [0900414]To Surya they assigned the skin, to Sinivali inward parts. [p. a367]
   The Slaughterer hath the feet, they said, when they distributed
    the Bull.
 [0900415]They made a jest of kindred's curse: a jar of Soma juice was set,
   What time the deities, convened, assigned the Bull's divided
    parts.
 [0900416]They gave the hooves to tortoises, to Sarama scraps of the feet:
   His undigested food they gave to worms and things that creep
    and crawl.
 [0900417]That Bull, the husband of the kine, pierces the demons with his
    horns,
   Banishes famine with his eye, and hears good tidings with his
    ears.
 [0900418]With hundred sacrifices he worships: the fires consume him not:
   All Gods promote the Braman who offers the Bull in sacrifice.
 [0900419]He who hath given away the Bull to Brahmans frees and cheers
    his soul.
   In his own cattle-pen he sees the growth and increase of his
    cows.
 [0900420]Let there be cattle, let there be bodily strength and progeny:
   All this may the Gods kindly grant to him who gives away the
   Bull.
 [0900421]Indra here verily hath rejoiced: let him bestow conspicuous
    wealth.
   May he draw forth at will from yonder side of heaven a deft
    cow, good to milk, whose calf is never wanting.
 [0900422]With close connexion mingle with the cows in this our cattle-
    pen:
   Mingle, the Bull's prolific flow, and, Indra! thine heroic
    strength!
 [0900423]Here we restore this Bull, your youthful leader: sporting with
    him, go, wander at your pleasure.
   Ne'er, wealthy ones! may he be reft of offspring; and do ye
    favour us with growth of riches.

HYMN V

  

A glorification of a sacrificial goat

[0900501]Seize him and bring him hither. Let him travel. foreknowing, to
    the regions of the pious.
   Crossing in many a place the mighty darkness, let the Goat
    mount to the third heaven above us.
 [0900502]I bring thee hither as a share for Indra; prince, at this sacrifice,.
    for him who worships.
   Grasp firmly from behind all those who hate us: so let the sacri-
    ficer's men be sinless.
 [0900503]Wash from his feet all trace of evil-doing: foreknowing, with
    cleansed hooves let him go upward.
   Gazing on many a spot, crossing the darkness, let the Goat
    mount to the third heaven above us.
 [0900504]Cut up this skin with the grey knife, Dissector! dividing joint
    from joint, and mangle nothing
   Do him no injury: limb by limb arrange him, and send him up
    to the third cope of heaven.
 [0900505]With verse upon the fire I set the caldron: pour in the water;
    lay him down within it! [p. a369]
   Encompass him with fire, ye Immolators. Cooked, let him reach
    the world where dwell the righteous.
 [0900506]Hence come thou forth, vexed by no pain or torment. Mount to
    the third heaven from the heated vessel.
   As fire out of the fire hast thou arisen. Conquer and win this
    lucid world of splendour.
 [0900507]The Goat is Agni: light they call him, saying that living man
    must give him to the Brahman.
   Given in this world by a devout believer, the Goat dispels and
    drives afar the darkness.
 [0900508]Let the Panchaudana Goat, about to visit the three lights, pass
    away in five divisions.
   Go midst the pious who have paid their worship, and parted,
    dwell on the third cope of heaven.
 [0900509]Rise to that world, O Goat, where dwell the righteous: pass, like
    a Sarabha veiled, all difficult places.
   The Goat Panchaudana, given to a Brahman, shall with all ful-
    ness satisfy the giver.
 [0900510]The Goat Panchaudana, given to a Brahman, sets the bestower
    on the pitch of heaven,
   In the third vault, third sky, third ridge. One only Cow omni-
    form art thou, that yields all wishes.
 [0900511]That is the third light that is yours, ye Fathers. He gives the
   Goat Panchaudana to the Brahman.
   Given in this world by the devout believer, the Goat dispels and
    drives afar the darkness.
 [0900512]Seeking the world of good men who have worshipped, he gives
    the Goat Panchaudana to the Brahman.
   Win thou this world as thy complete possession. Auspicious
    unto us be he, accepted!
 [0900513]Truly the Goat sprang from the glow of Agni, inspired as sage
    with all a sage's power.
   Sacrifice, filled, filled full, offered with Vashat--this let the Gods
    arrange.at proper seasons.
 [0900514]Home-woven raiment let him give, and gold as guerdon to the
    priests.
   So he obtains completely all celestial and terrestrial worlds.
 [0900515]Near to thee, Goat! approach these streams of Soma, divine,
    distilling meath, bedecked with butter! [p. a370]
   Stay thou the earth and sky and fix them firmly up on the seven-
    rayed pitch and height of heaven.
 [0900516]Unborn art thou, O Goat: to heaven thou goest. Though thee
   Angirases knew that radiant region.
   So may I know that holy world.
 [0900517]Convey our sacrifice to heaven, that it may reach the Gods, with
    that
   Whereby thou, Agni, bearest wealth in thousands, and all pre-
    cious things.
 [0900518]The Goat Panchaudana, when cooked, transporteth, repelling
   Nirriti, to the world of Svarga.
   By him may we win worlds which Surya brightens.
 [0900519]The droppings of the Odanas attending the Goat which I have
    lodged with priest or people
   May all this know us in the world of virtue, O Agni, at the
    meeting of the pathways.
 [0900520]This Unborn cleft apart in the beginning: his breast became the
    earth, his back was heaven.
   His middle was the air, his sides the regions; the hollows of his
    belly formed both oceans.
 [0900521]His eyes were Truth and Right. The whole together was Truth:
   Viraj his head and Faith his breathing.
   This Goat Panchaudana was indeed a sacrifice unlimited.
 [0900522]A boundless sacrifice he performs, he wins himself a boundless
    world:
   Who gives the Goat Panchaudana illumined with a priestly fee.
 [0900523]Let him not break the victim's bones, let him not suck the
    marrow out.
   Let the man, taking him entire, here, even here deposit him.
 [0900524]This, even this is his true form: the man uniteth him therewith.
   Food, greatness, strength he bringeth him who giveth the Goat
   Panchaudana illumed with guerdon.
 [0900525]The five gold pieces, and the five new garments, and the five
    milch-kine yield him all his wishes.
   Who gives the Goat Panchaudana illumined with a priestly
    fee.
 [0900526]The five gold pieces, area light to light him, robes become armour
    to defend his body;
   He winneth Svarga as his home who giveth the Goat Panchaud-
    ana illumed with bountry. [p. a371]
 [0900527]When she who hath been wedded finds a second husband after-
    ward,
   The twain shall not be parted if they give the Goat Panchaud-
    ana.
 [0900528]One world with the re-wedded wife becomes the second hus-
    band's home.
   Who gives the Goat Panchaudana illumined with the priestly fee.
 [0900529]They who have given a cow who drops a calf each season, or an
    ox,
   A coverlet, a robe, or gold, go to the loftiest sphere of heaven.
 [0900530]Himself, the father and the son, the grandson, and the father's
    sire,
   Mother, wife, her who bore his babes, all the beloved ones I call.
 [0900531]The man who knows the season named the Scorching--the Goat
   Pafichaudana is this scorching season
   He lives himself, he verily burns up his hated rival's fame,
   Who gives the Goat Panchaudana illumined with the priestly
    fee.
 [0900532]The man who knows the season called the Working takes to
    himself the active fame, his hated rival's active fame.
   The Goat Panchaudana is this Working season.
   He lives himself, etc.
 [0900533]The man who knows the season called the Meeting takes to him-
    self the gathering fame, his hated rival's gathering fame.
   The Goat Panchaudana is this Meeting season.
 [0900534]The man who knows the called the Swelling takes to himself the
    swelling fame, his hated rival's swelling fame.
   The Goat Panchaudana is this Swelling season.
   He lives himself, etc.
 [0900535]The man who knows the season called the Rising takes to him-
    self the rising fame, his hated rival's rising fame.
   The Goat Panchaudana in this Rising season.
 [0900536]The man who knows the season called Surpassing takes to him-
    self the conquering fame, his hated rival's conquering fame.
   The Goat Panchaudana is this Conquering season.
   He lives himself, he verily burns up his hated rival's fame
   Who gives the Goat Panchaudana illumined with a priestly fee.
 [0900537]He cooks the Goat and the five boiled rice messes. May the uni-
    ted Quarters, all accordant, and intermediate points, accept
    him from thee. [p. a372]
 [0900538]May these preserve him for thee. Here I offer t o these the molten
    butter as oblation.

HYMN VI

  

A glorification of hospitable reception of guests

[0900601]Whoso will know Prayer with immediate knowledge, whose mem-
    bers are the stuff, whose spine the verses:
 [0900602]Whose hairs are psalms, whose heart is called the Yajus, whose
    coverlet is verily oblation--
 [0900603]Verily when a host looks at his guests he looks at the place of
    sacrifice to the Gods.
 [0900604]When he salutes them reverently he undergoes preparation for
    a religious ceremony: when he calls for water, he solemnly
    brings sacrificial water.
 [0900605]The water that is solemnly brought at a sacrifice is this same
    water.
 [0900606]The libation which they bring; the sacrificial victim dedicated
    to Agni and Soma which is tied to the post, that, verily, is
    this man.
 [0900607]When they arrange dwelling-rooms they arrange the sacred
    chamber and the shed for housing the Soma cars.
 [0900608]What they spread upon the floor is just Sacrificial Grass.
 [0900609]With the couch that the men bring, he wins for himself the
    world of Svarga.
 [0900610]The pillow-coverings that they bring are the green sticks that
    surround the sacrificial altar.
 [0900611]The ointment that they bring for injunction is just clarified
    liquid butter.
 [0900612]The food they bring before the general distribution represents
    the two sacrificial cakes of rice meal. [p. a374]
 [0900613]When they call the man who prepares food they summon the
    preparer of oblation.
 [0900614]The grains of rice and barley that are selected are just filaments
    of the Soma plant.
 [0900615]The pestle and mortar are really the stones of the Soma press.
 [0900616]The winnowing-basket is the filter, the chaff the Soma dregs,
    the water, the pressing-gear.
 [0900617]Spoon, ladle, fork, stirring-prong are the wooden Soma tubs;
    the earthen cooking-pots are the mortar-shaped Soma
    vessels; this earth is just the black-antelope's skin.
 [0900618]Or the host acts in this way to a Yajamana's Brahman: when
    he looks at the furniture and utensils he says, More here t
    yet more here.
 [0900619]When he says, Bring out more, he lengthens his life thereby.
 [0900620]He brings oblations: he makes the men sit down.
 [0900621]As the guest of the seated company he himself offers up
    sacrifice.
 [0900622]With ladle, with hand, in life, at the sacrificial post, with cry of
   Ladle! with exclamation of Vashat!
 [0900623]Now these guests, as priests beloved or not beloved, bring one
    to the world of Svarga.
 [0900624]He who hath this knowledge should not eat hating, should not
    eat the food of one who hates him, nor of one who is doubt-
    ful, nor of one who is undecided.
 [0900625]This man whose food they eat hath all his wickedness blotted
    out.
 [0900626]All that man's sin whose food they do not eat remains unblot-
    ted out.
 [0900627]The man who supplies food hath always pressing stones adjusted,
    a wet Soma filter, well prepared religious rites, and mental
    power to complete the arranged sacrifice.
 [0900628]The arranged sacrifice of the man who offers food is a sacrifice
    to Prajapati.
 [0900629]The man who offers food follows the steps of Prajapati.
 [0900630]The fire of the guests is the Ahavaniya, the fire in the dwelling
    is the Garhapatya, that whereon they cook food is the South-
    ern Sacrificial Fire.
 [0900631]Now that man who eats before the guest eats up the sacrifice
    and the merit of the house.
 [0900632]He devours the milk and the sap: [p. a375]
 [0900633]And the vigour and prosperity.
 [0900634]And the progeny and the cattle:
 [0900635]And the fame and reputation.
 [0900636]The man who eats before the guest eats up the glory and the
    understanding of the house.
 [0900637]The man should not eat before the guest who is a Brahman
    versed in holy lore.
 [0900638]When the guest hath eaten he should eat. This is the rule for
    the animation of the sacrifice and the preservation of its
    continuity.
 [0900639]Now the sweetest portion, the produce of the cow, milk, or
    flesh, that verily he should not eat.
 [0900640]The man who having this knowledge pours out milk and offers
    it wins for himself as much thereby as he gains by the perfor-
    mance of a very successful Agnishtoma sacrifice.
 [0900641]The man who having this knowledge pours out clarified butter
    and offers it wins for himself thereby as much as he gains by
    the performance of a very successful Atiratra sacrifice.
 [0900642]He who pours out mead and offers it wins for himself thereby
    as much as he gains by the performance of a very successful
   Sattrasadya sacrifice.
 [0900643]He who having this knowledge besprinkles flesh and offers it
    wins for himself thereby as much as he gains by the perfor-
    mance of a very successful Twelve-Day sacrifice.
 [0900644]The man who having this knowledge pours out water and offers
    it obtains a resting-place for the procreation of living beings
    and becomes dear to living beings, even the man who having
    this knowledge pours out water and offers it.
 [0900645]For him Dawn murmurs, and Savitar sings the prelude; Brihas-
    pati chants with vigour, and Tvashtar joins in with increase;
    the Visve Devah take up conclusion. He who hath this know-
    ledge is the abiding-place of welfare, of progeny, and of
    cattle.
 [0900646]For him the rising Sun murmurs, and Early Morning sings the
    prelude; Noon chants the psalm, Afternoon joins in; the
    setting Sun takes up the conclusion. He who hath this know-
    ledge is the abiding place of welfare, of progeny, and of
    cattle.
 [0900647]For him the Rain-cloud murmurs when present, sings the pre-
    lude when thundering, joins in when lightening, chants the [p. a376]
    psalm when raining, and takes up the conclusion when it stays
    the downpour. He who hath this knowledge is the abiding-
    place of welfare, of progeny, and of cattle.
 [0900648]He looks at the guests, he utters a gentle sound; he speaks, he
    signs the prelude; he calls for water, he chants the psalm; he
    offers the residue of the sacrifice, he takes up the conclusion.
 [0900649]When he summons the door-keeper he gives instruction.
 [0900650]He (the door-keeper) pronounces the sacrificial formula in his
    answer to what he hears.
 [0900651]When the attendants with vessels in their hands, foremost and
    hindmost, come in, they are just the priests who manage the
   Soma cups.
 [0900652]Not one of them is incompetent to sacrifice.
 [0900653]Or if the host, having offered food to his guest, goes up to the
    house, he virtually enters the bath of purification.
 [0900654]When he distributes food he distributes priestly fees; what he
    performs he asks as favour.
 [0900655]He having been invited on earth, regales, invited in that, which
    wears all various forms on earth.
 [0900656]He, having been invited in air, regales, invited, in that which
    wears all various forms in air.
 [0900657]He having been invited in the sky, regales, invited, in that which
    wears all various forms in the sky.
 [0900658]He, having been invited among the gods, regales, invited in that
    which wears all various forms among the Gods.
 [0900659]He, having been invited in the worlds, regales, invited, in that
    which wears all various forms in the worlds.
 [0900660]He, having been invited hath been invited.
 [0900661]He gains this world and the world yonder.
 [0900662]He who hath this knowledge wins the luminous spheres.

 [0900704]His universe is Vayu, Svarga is his world, Krishpadram is the
    tendons and Vertebrae. [p. a378]
 [0900705]The Syena ceremony is the breast, Air is the region of the belly,.
   Brihaspati is the hump, Brihati the breast-bone and cartilages
    of the ribs.
 [0900706]The consorts of the Gods are the ribs, the attendants are ribs.

 [0900709]Priestly rank and princely power are the hips, and strength is.

 [0900720]Standing east-wards he is Indra, standing southwards, Yama.
 [0900721]Standing westwards he is Dhatar, standing northwards Savitar.
 [0900722]When he hath got his grass he is King Soma.
 [0900723]He is Mitra when he looks about him, and when he hath turned
    round he is joy.
 [0900724]When he is yoking he belongs to the All-Gods, when yoked he
    is Prajapati, when unyoked he is All.
 [0900725]This verily is omniform, wearing all forms, bovine-formed.
 [0900726]Upon him wait omniform beasts, wearing every shape, each one
    who hath this knowledge.

    insensible
   I have evoked the poison-taint of all Consumptions out of thee.
 [0900820]Of piercing pain, of abscesses, rheumatic ache, ophthalmia--
   I have evoked the poison-taint of all Consumptions out of thee.
 [0900821]I have dispelled the piercing pains from feet, knees, hips, and
    hinder parts,
   And spine, and from the neck and nape the malady that racked

    disease, hast stilled the pain that racked the limbs.

HYMN IX

  

Enunciation of mystico-theological and cosmological doctrine

[0900901]The second brother of this lovely Hotar, hoary with eld, is the
    voracious Lightning.
   The third is he whose back is balmed with butter. Here have I
    seen the King with seven male children.
 [0900902]The seven make the one-wheeled chariot ready: bearing seven
    names the single Courser draws it.
   The wheel, three-naved, is sound and undecaying: thereon these
    worlds of life are all dependent.
 [0900903]The seven who on this seven-wheeled car are mounted have
    horses, seven in tale, who draw them onward.
   Seven sisters utter songs of praise together, in whom the Cows'
    seven names are held and treasured.
 [0900904]Who hath beheld at birth the Primal Being, when She who hath
    no bone supports the bony?
   Where is the blood of earth, the life, the spirit? Who may ap-
    proach the man who knows, to ask it?
 [0900905]Let him who knoweth presently declare it, this lovely Bird's
    securely-founded station.
   Forth from his head the Cows draw milk, and wearing his ves-
    ture with their foot have drunk the water.
 [0900906]Unripe in mind, in spirit undiscerning, I ask of these the Gods'
    established places.
   High up above the yearling Calf the sages, to form a web, their
    own seven threads have woven.
 [0900907]Here, ignorant, I ask the wise who know it, as one who knows
    not, for the sake of knowledge,
   What is That One, who in the Unborn's image hath stablished
    and fixed firm this world's six regions.
 [0900908]The Mother gave the Sire his share of Order. With thought at
    first she wedded him in spirit.
   She, coyly loth, was filled with dew prolific. With adoration
    men approached to praise her.
 [0900909]Yoked was the Mother to the boon Cow's car-pole; in humid
    folds of cloud the infant rested.
   Then the Calf lowed and looked upon the Mother, the Cow
    who wears all shapes in three directions.
 [0900910]Bearing three mothers and three fathers, single he stood erect:
    they never made him weary. [p. a383]
   On yonder heaven's high ridge they speak together in speech
    not known to all, themselves all-knowing.
 [0900911]Upon the five-spoked wheel revolving ever, whereon all crea-
    tures rest and are dependent,
   The axle, heavy-laden, is not heated: the nave from ancient
    time remains unheated.
 [0900912]They call him in the farther half of heaven the Sire five-footed,
    of twelve forms, wealthy in watery store.
   These others, later still, say that he takes his stand upon a seven-
    wheeled car, six-spoked, whose sight is clear.
 [0900913]Formed with twelve spokes, too strong for age to weaken, this
    wheel of during Order rolls round heaven.
   Herein established, joined in pairs together, seven hundred sons
    and twenty stand, O Agni.
 [0900914]The wheel revolves, unwasting, with its felly: ten draw it, yoked
    to the far-stretching car-pole.
   Girt by the region moves the eye of Surya, on whom dependent
    rest all living creatures.
 [0900915]They told me these were males, though truly females. He who
    hath eyes sees this, the blind discerns not.
   The son who is a sage hath comprehended: who knows this
    rightly is his father's father.
 [0900916]Of the co-born they call the seventh single-born: the six twin,
    pairs are called the Rishis, sons of Gods.
   Their good gifts sought of men are ranged in order due, and,
    various, form by form, move for their guiding Lord.
 [0900917]Beneath the upper realm, above this lower, bearing her Calf at
    foot, the Cow hath risen.
   Whitherward, to what place hath she departed? Where doth she
    calve? Not in this herd of cattle.
 [0900918]Who, that the father of this Calf discerneth beneath the upper
    realm, above the lower,
   Showing himself a sage, may here declare him? Whence hath
    the godlike spirit had its rising?
 [0900919]Those that come hitherward they call departing, those that depart
    they call directed hither.
   Whatever ye have made, Indra and Soma! steeds draw, as' twere,
    yoked to the region's car-pole.
 [0900920]Two Birds with fair wings, knit with bonds of friendship, in the
    same sheltering tree have found a refuge, [p. a384]
   One of the twain eats the sweet Fig-tree's berry: the other, eat-
    ing not, regardeth only.
 [0900921]The tree whereon the fine Birds eat the sweetness, where they
    all rest and procreate their offspring
   Upon the top, they say the fruit is luscious: none gaineth it who
    knoweth not the Father.
 [0900922]Where the fine birds hymn ceaselessly their portion of life eter-
    nal, and the sacred synods.
   There is the Universe's Guard and Keeper who, wise hath
    entered into me the simple.

HYMN X

  

Continuation of Hymn 9

[0901001]How on the Gayatri the Gayatri was based; how from the
   Trishtup they fashioned the Trishtup forth:
   How on the Jagati was based the Jagati--they who know this
    have won themselves immortal life.
 [0901002]With Gayatri he measures out the praise-song, Saman with
    praise-song, triplet with the Trishtup, [p. a387]
   The triplet with the two or four-foot measure, and with the
    syllable they form seven metres.
 [0901003]With Jagati the flood in heaven he stablished, and saw the Sun
    in the Rathantara Saman.
   Gayatri hath, they say, three logs for burning: hence it excels
    in majesty and vigour.
 [0901004]I invocate this Milch-cow good at milking, so that the Milker,
    deft of hand, may milk her.
   May "Savitar give goodliest stimulation. The caldron is made
    hot: he will proclaim it.
 [0901005]She, Lady of all treasures, hath come hither, yearning in spirit
    for her calf, and lowing.
   May this Cow yield her milk for both the Asvins, and may she
    prosper to our high advantage.
 [0901006]The Cow hath lowed after her blinking youngling: she licks his
    forehead as she lows, to form it.
   His mouth she fondly calls to her warm udder, and suckles him
    with milk while gently lowing.
 [0901007]He also snorts, by whom encompassed round the Cow lows as
    she closely clings to him who sheds the rain.
   She with her shrilling cries hath humbled mortal men, and turn-
    ed to lightning, hath stripped off her covering robe.
 [0901008]That which hath breath and life and speed and motion lies
    firmly stablished in the midst of houses.
   The living moves by powers of the departed: the immortal is
    the brother of the mortal.
 [0901009]The old hath waked the young Moon from his slumber, who
    runs his circling course with many round him.
   Behold the God's high wisdom in its greatness: he who died
    yesterday to-day is living.
 [0901010]He who hath made him doth not comprehend him: from him
    who saw him surely he is hidden.
   He, yet enveloped in his mother's bosom, source of much life,
    hath sunk into destruction.
 [0901011]I saw the Herdsman, him who never stumbles, approaching by
    his pathways and departing.
   He clothed with gathered and diffusive splendours, within the
    worlds continually travels.
 [0901012]Dyaus is our father, our begetter: kinship is here. This great
   Earth is our kin and mother. [p. a388]
   Between the wide-spread world-halves is the birth-place. The
   Father laid the Daughter's germ within it.
 [0901013]I bid thee tell me earth's extremest limit, about the Stallion's
    genial flow I ask thee;
   I ask about the universe's centre, and touching highest heaven
    where Speech abideth.
 [0901014]The earth's most distant limit is this altar: this Soma is the
   Stallion's genial humour;
   This sacrifice the universe's centre: this Brahman highest heaven
    where Speech abideth.
 [0901015]What thing I truly am I know not clearly: mysterious, fettered
    in my mind I wander.
   When the first-born of holy Law approached me, then of this
   Speech I first obtain a portion.
 [0901016]Back, forward goes he, grasped by power inherent, immortal
    born the brother of the mortal.
   Ceaseless they move in opposite directions: men mark the one
    and fail to mark the other.
 [0901017]Seven germs unripened yet are Heaven's prolific seed: their
    functions they maintain by Vishnu's ordinance.
   Endued with wisdom through intelligence and thought, present
    on every side they compass us about.
 [0901018]Upon what syllable of holy praise-hymn, as 'twere their highest
    heaven, the Gods repose them
   Who knows not this, what will he do with praise-hymn? But
    they who know it well sit here assembled.
 [0901019]They, ordering the verse's foot by measure, with the half-verse
    arranged each thing that moveth.
   Prayer was diffused in many forms three-footed thereby the
    world's four regions have their being
 [0901020]Fortunate mayst thou be with goodly pasture, and may we also
    be exceeding wealthy.
   Feed on the grass, O Cow, through all the seasons, and coming
    hitherward drink limpid water.
 [0901021]Forming the water-floods the Cow herself hath lowed, one-foot-
    ed or two-footed or four-footed, she,
   Who hath become eight-footed or acquired nine feet, the uni-
    verse's thousand-syllabled Pankti. From her descend in
    streams the seas of water. [p. a389]
 [0901022]Dark the descent: the birds are golden-coloured. Robed in the
    floods they fly aloft to heaven.
   Again from Order's seat have they descended, and inundated all
    the earth with fatness.
 [0901023]The footless Maid precedeth footed creatures. Who marketh,
   Mitra Varuna! this your doing?
   The Babe unborn supporteth this world's burthen, supporteth
   Right and watcheth Wrong and Falsehood.
 [0901024]Viraj is Speech, and Earth, and Air's mid-region. He is Praja-
    pati, and he is Mrityu.
   He is the Lord Imperial of the Sadhyas. He rules what is and
    what shall be hereafter. May he make me lord of what is and
    shall be.
 [0901025]1 saw from far away the smoke of fuel with spires that rose on
    high o'er that beneath it.
   The heroes cooked and dressed the spotted bullock. These were
    the customs in the days aforetime.
 [0901026]Three with long tresses show in ordered season. One of them
    sheareth when the year is ended.
   One with his powers the universe regardeth. Of one the sweep
    is seen, but not the figure.
 [0901027]Speech hath been measured out in four divisions: the Brahmans
    who have wisdom comprehend them.
   Three, kept in close concealment, cause no motion. Of Speech
    men speak the fourth division only.
 [0901028]They call him Indra, Mitra, Varuna, Agni; and he is heavenly
    nobly-winged Garutman.
   That which is One bards call by many a title: they call It Agni,
   Yama, Matariswan.

A charm against witchcraft

[1000101]Afar let her depart: away we drive her whom, made with hands,
    all-beautiful,
   Skilled men prepare and fashion like a bride amid her nuptial
    train.
 [1000102]Complete, with head and nose and ears, all-beauteous, wrought

   Afar let her depart: away we drive her.
 [1000103]Made by a Sidra or a Prince, by priests or women let her go.
   Back to her maker as her kin, like a dame banished by her lord.
 [1000104]I with this salutary herb have ruined all their magic arts,
   The spell which they have cast upon thy field, thy cattle, or thy
    men.
 [1000105]Ill fall on him who doeth ill, on him who curseth fall the
    curse!
   We drive her back that she may slay the man who wrought the
    witchery.
 [1000106]Against her comes the Angirasa, the Priest whose eye is over us.
   Turn back all witcheries and slay those practisers of magic arts.
 [1000107]Whoever said to thee, Go forth against the foeman up the
    stream,
   To him, O Kritya, go thou back. Pursue not us, the sinless
    ones.
 [1000108]He who composed thy limbs with thought as a deft joiner builds
    a car,
   Go to him: thither lies thy way. This man is all unknown to
    thee.
 [1000109]The cunning men, the sorcerers who fashioned thee and held thee
    fast,-- [p. 2]
   This cures and mars their witchery, this, repellent, drives it back
    the way it came. With this we make thee swim.
 [1000110]When we have found her ducked and drenched, a hapless cow
    whose calf hath died,
   Let all my woe depart and let abundant riches come to me.
 [1000111]If, as they gave thy parents aught, they named thee, or at sacri-
    fice,
   From all their purposed evil let these healing herbs deliver thee.
 [1000112]From mention of thy name, from sin against the Fathers or the
   Gods,
   These herbs of healing shall by prayer release thee, by power,
    by holy texts, the milk of .Rishis.
 [1000113]As the wind stirs the dust from earth and drives the rain cloud
    from the sky,
   So, chased and banished by the spell, all misery departs from
    me.
 [1000114]Go with a resonant cry, depart, like a she-ass whose cords are
    loosed.
   Go to thy makers: hence! away! Go driven by the potent
    spell.
 [1000115]This, Kritya, is thy path, we say, and guide thee. We drive thee
    back who hast been sent against us.
   Go by this pathway, breaking loose for onslaught even as a host
    complete with cars and horses.
 [1000116]No path leads hitherward for thee to travel. Turn thee from us:
    far off, thy light is yonder.
   Fly hence across the ninety floods, the rivers most hard to pass.
   Begone, and be not wounded.
 [1000117]As wind the trees, so smite and overthrow them: leave not cow,
    horse, or man of them surviving
   Return, O Kritya, unto those who made thee. Wake them from
    sleep to find that they are childless.
 [1000118]The charm or secret power which they have buried for thee in
    sacred grass, field, cemetery,
   Or spell in household fire which men more cunning have
    wrought against thee innocent and simple,--
 [1000119]That tool of hatred, understood, made ready, stealthy and buried
    deep, have we discovered, [p. 3]
   Let that go back to whence it came, turn thither like a horse
    and kill the children of the sorcerer.
 [1000120]Within our house are swords of goodly iron. Kritya, we know
    thy joints and all their places.
   Arise this instant and begone! What, stranger! art thou seek-
    ing here?
 [1000121]O Kritya, I will cut thy throat and hew thy feet off. Run, be-
    gone!
   Indra and Agni, Guardian Lords of living creatures, shield us
    well!
 [1000122]May Soma, gracious friend, imperial Sovran, and the world's
   Masters look on us with favour.
 [1000123]Bhava and Sarva cast the flash of lightning, the weapon of the
   Gods, against the sinner who made the evil thing, who deals
    in witchcraft!
 [1000124]If thou hast come two-footed or four-footed, made by the
    sorcerer, wrought in perfect beauty,
   Become eight-footed and go hence. Speed back again, thou evil
    one.
 [1000125]Anointed, balmed, and well adorned, bearing all trouble with
    thee, go.
   Even as a daughter knows her sire, so know thy marker, Kritya,
    thou.
 [1000126]Kritya, begone, stay not. Pursue as 'twere the wounded crea-
    ture's track.
   He is the chase, the hunter thou he may not slight or humble thee.
 [1000127]He waits, and aiming with his shaft smites him who first would
    shoot at him,
   And, when the foeman deals a blow before him, following strikes
    him down.
 [1000128]Hearken to this my word; then go thither away whence thou
    hast come; to him who made thee go thou back.
 [1000129]The slaughter of an innocent, O Kritya, is an awful deed. Slay
    not cow, horse, or man of ours.
   In whatsoever place thou art concealed we rouse thee up there-
    from: become thou lighter than a leaf.
 [1000130]If ye be girt about with clouds of darkness, bound as with a
    net.
   We rend and tear all witcheries hence and to their maker send
    them back. [p. 4]
 [1000131]The brood of wizard, sorcerer, the purposer of evil deed.
   Crush thou, O Kritya spare not, kill those practisers of magic
    arts.
 [1000132]As Surya frees himself from depth of darkness, and casts away
    the night and rays of morning,
   So I repel each baleful charm which an enchanter hath pre-
    pared;
   And, as an elephant shakes off the dust, I cast the plague aside.

HYMN II

  

Purusha, Primeval Man or humanity personified

[1000201]Who framed the heels of Purusha? Who fashioned the flesh of
    him? Who formed and fixed his ankles?
   Who made the openings and well-moulded fingers? Who gave
    him foot-soles and a central station?
 [1000202]Whence did they make the ankles that are under, and the knee-
    bones of Purusha above them?
   What led them onward to the legs' construction? Who planned
    and formed the knees' articulations?
 [1000203]A fourfold frame is fixt with ends connected, and up above the
    knees a yielding belly.
   The hips and thighs, who was their generator, those props where-
    by the trunk grew firmly stablished?
 [1000204]Who and how many were those Gods who fastened the chest of
   Purusha and neck together?
   How many fixed his breasts? Who formed his elbows? How
    many joined together ribs and shoulders?
 [1000205]Who put together both his arms and said, Let him show manly
    strength?
   Who and what God was he who set the shoulderblades upon
    the trunk?
 [1000206]Who pierced the seven openings in the head? Who made these
    ears, these nostrils, eyes, and mouth,
   Through whose surpassing might in all directions bipeds and
    quadrupeds have power of motion?
 [1000207]He set within the jaws the tongue that reaches far, and thereon
    placed Speech the mighty Goddess.
   He wanders to and fro mid living creatures, robed in the waters.
   Who hath understood it?
 [1000208]Who was he, first, of all the Gods who fashioned his skull and
    brain and occiput and forehead,
   The pile that Purusha's two jaws supported? Who was that
   God who mounted up to heaven?
 [1000209]Whence bringeth mighty Purusha both pleasant and unpleasant
    things,
   Of varied sort, sleep, and alarm, fatigue, enjoyments and de-
    lights?
 [1000210]Whence is there found in Purusha want, evil, suffering, dis-
    tress? [p. 6]
   Whence come success, prosperity opulence, thought, and utte-
    rance?
 [1000211]Who stored in him floods turned in all directions, moving diverse
    and formed to flow in rivers,
   Hasty, red, copper-hued, and purple, running all ways in
   Purusha, upward and downward?
 [1000212]Who gave him visible form and shape? Who gave him magni-
    tude and name?
   Who gave him motion, consciousness? Who furnished Purusha
    with feet?
 [1000213]Who wove the vital air in him, who filled him with the down-
    ward breath?
   What God bestowed on Purusha the general pervading air?
 [1000214]What God, what only Deity placed sacrifice in Purusha?
   Who gave him truth and falsehood? Whence came Death and
    immortality?
 [1000215]Who wrapped a garment round him? Who arranged the life he
    hath to live?
   Who granted him the boon of speech? Who gave this fleetness
    to his feet?
 [1000216]Through whom did he spread waters out, through whom did he
    make Day to shine?
   Through whom did he enkindle Dawn and give the gift of even-
    tide?
 [1000217]Who set the seed in him and said, Still be the thread of life spun
    out?
   Who gave him intellect besides? Who gave him voice and
    gestic power?
 [1000218]Through whom did he bedeck the earth, through whom did he
    encompass heaven?
   Whose might made Purusha surpass the mountains and created
    things?
 [1000219]Through whom seeks he Parjanya out, and Soma of the piercing
    sight?
   Through whom belief and sacrifice? Through whom was spirit
    laid in him?
 [1000220]What leads him to the learned priest? What leads him to this
   Lord Supreme?
   How doth he gain this Agni? By whom hath he measured out
    the year? [p. 7]
 [1000221]He, Brahma gains the learned priest, he Brahma, gains this Lord
   Supreme.
   As Brahma, Man wins Agni here Brahma hath measured out the
    year.
 [1000222]Through whom doth he abide with Gods? Through whom with
    the Celestial Tribes?
   Why is this other called a star? Why is this called the Real
   Power?
 [1000223]Brahma inhabits with the Gods, Brahma among the Heavenly
   Tribes.
   Brahma this other star is called. Brahma is called the Real
   Power.
 [1000224]By whom was this our earth disposed? By whom was heaven
    placed over it?
   By whom was this expanse of air raised up on high and stre-
    tched across?
 [1000225]By Brahma was this earth disposed: Brahma is sky arranged
    above.
   Brahma is this expanse of air lifted on high and stretched
    across.
 [1000226]Together, with his needle hath Atharvan sewn his head and
    heart.
   And Pavamana hovered from his head on high above his brain.
 [1000227]That is indeed Atharvan's head, the well-closed casket of the
   Gods.
   Spirit and Food and Vital Air protect that head from injury.
 [1000228]Stationed on high, Purusha hath pervaded all regions spread
    aloft and stretched transversely.
   He who knows Brahma's cattle, yea, the fort whence Purusha is
    named,
 [1000229]Yea, knows that fort of Brahma girt about with immortality,
   Brahma and Brahmas have bestowed sight, progeny, and life on
    him.
 [1000230]Sight leaves him not, breath quits not him before life's natural
    decay,
   Who knows the fort of Brahma, yea, the fort whence Purusha
    is named.
 [1000231]The fort of Gods, impregnable, with circles eight and portals
    nine, [p. 8]
   Contains a golden treasure-chest, celestial, begirt with light.
 [1000232]Men deep in lore of Brahma know that Animated Being which
   Dwells in the golden treasure-chest that hath three spokes and
    three supports.
 [1000233]Brahma hath passed within the fort, the golden castle; ne'er
    subdued,
   Bright with excessive brilliancy, compassed with glory round
    about.

HYMN III

  

Purusha, Primeval Man or humanity personified

[1000301]Here is my charm the Varana, slayer of rivals, strong in act.
   With this grasp thou thine enemies, crush those who fain would
    injure thee.
 [1000302]Break them in pieces; grasp them and destroy them. This Amu-
    let shall go before and lead thee.
   With Varana the Gods, from morn to morning, have warded off
    the Asuras' enchantment.
 [1000303]This charm, this Varana healeth all diseases, bright with a thou-
    sand eyes and golden glister.
   This charm shall conquer and cast down thy foemen. Be thou
    the first to slay the men who hate thee.
 [1000304]This will stay witchcraft wrought for thee, will guard thee from
    the fear of man:
   From all distress and misery this Varana will shield thee well.
 [1000305]Guard against ill of varied kind is Varana this heavenly Plant.
   The Gods have stayed and driven off Consumption which had
    seized this man.
 [1000306]If in thy sleep thou see an evil vision, oft as the beast repeats his
    loathed approaches,
   This Amulet, this Varana will guard thee from sneeze, and from
    the bird's ill-omened message.
 [1000307]From Mischief, from Malignity, from incantation, from alarm,
   From death, from stronger foeman's stroke the Varana will
    guard thee well.
 [1000308]Each sinful act that we have done,--my mother, father, and my
    friends,-- [p. 10]
   From all the guilt this heavenly Plant will be our guard and
    sure defence.
 [1000309]Affrighted by the Varana let my rivals near akin to me
   Pass to the region void of light: to deepest darkness let them
    go.
 [1000310]Safe are my cattle, safe am I, long-lived with all my men
    around.
   This Varana, mine Amulet, shall guard me well on every side.
 [1000311]This Varana is on my breast, the sovran, the celestial Plant.
   Let it afflict my foemen as Indra quelled fiends and Asuras.
 [1000312]Through hundred autumn seasons, long to live, I wear this
    Varana.
   May it bestow on me great strength, cattle, and royalty and
    power.
 [1000313]As with its might the wind breaks down the trees, the sovrans
    of the wood,
   So break and rend my rivals, born before me and born after.
   Let the Varana protect thee well.
 [1000314]As Agni and the wind devour the trees, the sovrans of the wood,
   Even so devour my rivals, born before me and born after. Let
    the Varana protect thee well.
 [1000315]As, shattered by the tempest, trees lie withering ruined on the
    ground.
   Thus over throw my rivals thou, so crush them down and ruin.
    them, those born before and after. Let this Varana protect
    thee well.
 [1000316]Cut them in pieces, Varana! before their destined term of life,
   Those who would hurt his cattle, those who fain would harm.
    the realm he rules.
 [1000317]As Surya shines with brightest sheen, as splendour hath been
    stored in him,
   So may the Charm, the Varana, give me prosperity and fame.
   With lustre let it sprinkle me, and balm me with magni-
    ficence.
 [1000318]As glory dwelleth in the Moon and in the Sun who vieweth
    men,
   So may the Charm, etc.
 [1000319]As glory dwelleth in the Earth, and in this Jatavedas here,
   So may the Charm etc. [p. 11]
 [1000320]As glory dwelleth in a maid, and in this well-constructed car,
   So may the Charm, etc.
 [1000321]As glory dwelleth in the draught of Soma and the honeyed.
    drink,
   So may the Charm, etc.
 [1000322]As glory dwells in sacrifice to Agni, and the hallowing word,
   So may the Charm, etc.
 [1000323]As glory is bestowed upon the patron and this sacrifice,
   So may the Charm, etc.
 [1000324]As glory dwelleth in the Lord of Life and in this God Supreme,.
   So may the Charm, etc.
 [1000325]As immortality and truth have been established in the Gods,
   So may the Charm, the Varana, give me prosperity and fame.
   With lustre let it sprinkle me, and balm me with magnificence.

HYMN IV

  

A charm to destroy venomous serpents

[1000402]The first of all is Indra's car, next is the chariot of the Gods
    the third is Varuna's alone.
   The last, the Serpents' chariot, struck the pillar and then sped
    away. [p. 12]
 [1000402]Their lustre is the Darbha-grass, its young shoots are their
    horse's tail: the reed's plume is their chariot seat.
 [1000403]Strike out, white courser! with thy foot, strike both with fore
    and hinder foot,
   Stay the dire poison of the Snakes, and make it weak as soaking
    wood.
   -4. Loud neighing he hath dived below, and rising up again replied,
   Stayed the dire poison of the Snakes, and made it weak as
    soaking wood.
 [1000405]Paidva kills Kasarnila, kills both the white Serpent and the
    black,
   Paidva hath struck and cleft in twain Ratharvi's and the Viper's
    head.
 [1000406]Go onward, horse of Pedu! go thou first: we follow after thee.
   Cast thou aside the Serpents from the pathway whereupon we
    tread.
 [1000407]Here was the horse of Pedu born: this is the way that takes him
    hence.
   These are the tracks the courser left, the mighty slayer of the
   Snakes.
 [1000408]Let him not close the opened mouth, nor open that which now
    is closed.
   Two snakes are in this field, and both, female and male, are
    powerless.
 [1000409]Powerless are the serpents here, those that are near and those
    afar.
   I kill the scorpion with a club, and with a staff the new-come
    snake.
 [1000410]This is the remedy against Aghasva and the adder, both:
   Indra and Paidva have subdued and tamed the vicious snake for
    me.
 [1000411]We fix our thoughts on Pedu's horse, strong, off-spring of a
    stedfast line.
   Behind our backs the vipers here crouch down and lie in wait
    for us.
 [1000412]Bereft of life and poison they lie slain by bolt-armed Indra's
    hand. Indra and we have slaughtered them.
 [1000400]13. Tiraschirajis have been slain, and vipers crushed and brayed to
    bits. [p. 13]
   Slay Darvi in the Darbha-grass, Karikrata, and White and
   Black.
 [1000414]The young maid of Kirata race, a little damsel, digs the drug,
   Digs it with shovels wrought of gold on the high ridges of the
    hills.
 [1000415]Hither the young uuconquered leech who slays the speckled
    snake hath come.
   He verily demolishes adder and scorpion; both of them.
 [1000416]Indra, Mitra and Varuna, and Vata and Parjanya both have
    given the serpent up to me.
 [1000417]Indra hath given him up to me, the female viper and the male,
   The adder, him with stripes athwart. Kasarnila, Dasonasi.
 [1000418]O Serpent, Indra hath destroyed the sire who first engendered
    thee:
   And when these snakes are pierced and bored what sap and
    vigour will be theirs?
 [1000419]Their heads have I seized firmly as a fisher grasps the spotted
    prey,
   Waded half through the stream and washed the poison of the
    serpents off.
 [1000420]Let the floods hurry on and bear the poison of all snakes afar.
   Tiraschirajis have been slain and vipers crushed and brayed to
    bits.
 [1000421]As from the salutary plants I deftly pick the fibres out, And
    guide them skilfully like mares, so let thy venom, Snake!
    depart,
 [1000422]All poison that the sun and fire, all that the earth and plants
    contain,
   Poison of most effectual power--let all thy venom pass away.
 [1000423]Serpents which fire or plants have generated, those which have
    sprung from waters or the lightning,
   Whose mighty broods are found in many places, these serpents
    we will reverently worship.
 [1000424]Thou art a maid called Taudi, or Ghritachi is thy name. Thy
    place;
   Is underneath my foot. I take the poison-killing remedy.
 [1000425]From every member drive away the venom, and avoid the heart.
   Then let the poison's burning heat pass downward and away-
    from thee. [p. 14]
 [1000426]The bane hath fled afar. It wept, and asked the poison how it
    fared.
 [1000427]Agni hath found the venom of the serpent, Soma drawn it out.
   Back to the biter hath returned the poison, and the snake hath
    died.

HYMN V

  

A charm to overthrow a rival and gain strength, dignity, long life, children, and general prosperity

[1000501]Ye are the power of Indra, ye the force and strength of Indra,
    ye his hero might and manliness.
   I join you with the bonds of Prayer to the victorious enterprise.
 [1000506]For the victorious enterprise let all creation stand by me. For
    me ye, Waters, are prepared. [p. 15]
 [1000507]Ye are the share of Agni. Grant, O heavenly Waters unto us the
   Waters' brilliant energy.
   By statute of Prajapati I set you down for this our world.
 [1000515]Waters, your ceremonial share of Waters which the waters hold,
    which aids our sacrifice to Gods,
   This as a remnant here I leave. Do not thou wash it clean away.
   With this we let the man go by who hates us and whom we
    abhor.
   Him would I fain o'erthrow and slay with this our ceremonial
    act, with this our prayer, our thunder-bolt.
 [1000522]Whatever evil I have done within this last triennium,
   From all that woe and misery let the waters shield and guard
    me well.
 [1000523]Onward I urge your gathered floods: enter your own abiding-
    place,
   Uninjured and with all your strength. Let nothing bend or bow
    us down.
 [1000524]May the pure Waters cleanse us from defilement,
   Fair to behold remove our sin and trouble, and bear away ill-
    dream and all pollution.
 [1000525]Thou art the step of Vishnu, rival-slayer, sharpened by earth,
    aglow with fire of Agni,
   Earth have I ranged: from earth we bar him who hates us and
    whom we hate.
 [1000526]Ours is superior place and ours is conquest: may I in all fights
    tread down spite and malice.
   Let him not live, let vital breath desert him.
 [1000536]With this I here invest the power and splendour, the life of that
    man and his vital breathing, the son of such a sire and such a
    woman, here do I overthrow and cast him downward.
 [1000537]I follow Surya's course in heaven, the course that takes him to
    the South.
   May that bestow upon me wealth and glory of a Brahman's
    rank.
 [1000538]I turn me to the regions bright with splendour.
   May they bestow upon me wealth and glory of a Brahman's
    rank.
 [1000539]I turn me to the Rishis Seven. May they, etc.
 [1000540]I turn me unto Prayer. May that, etc.
 [1000541]I turn me unto Brahmans. May they etc. [p. 16]
 [1000542]We hunt that man, we beat him down and slay him with our
    murderous blows.
   We with the spell have hurried him to Parameshthin's opened
    jaws.
 [1000543]Let the shot missile catch him with Vaisvanara's two mighty
    fangs.
   This offering, and the mightiest Goddess, the Fuel, eat him up!
 [1000544]Thou art the bound of Varuna the King.
   Bind, such an one, the son of such a woman, in vital breath and
    in the food that feeds him.
 [1000545]All food of thine, O Lord of Life, that lies, upon the face of
    earth,
   Thereof bestow thou upon us. O Lord of Life, Prajapati!
 [1000546]Celestial Waters have I sought: with juice have I besprinkled
    them.
   With milk, O Agni, have I come; bestow upon me splendid
    strength.
 [1000547]Give me the boon of splendid strength; give, Agni! progeny
    and life.
   May the Gods know this prayer of mine, may Indra with the
   Rishis know.
 [1000548]What curse soever couples launch against us, whatever bitter
    speech the chatterers utter,
   With Manyu's arrow, offspring of the spirit, transfix thou to the
    heart the Yatudhanas,
 [1000549]Destroy the Yatudhanas with thy fervour, consume the demons
    with thy wrath, O Agni.
   Destroy the fool's gods with thy fiery splendour, destroy the
    blazing ones, the insatiable.
 [1000550]Well-skilled, against this man I hurl the Water's bolt with four
    spikes, to cleave his head asunder.
   May it destroy all members of his body. Let the whole host of
   Gods approve my purpose.

HYMN VI

  

The glorification of an all-powerful amulet

[1000601]With power I cut away the head of my malignant rival, of mine
    evil-hearted enemy.
 [1000602]This Amulet of citron-wood shall make for me a trusty shield
   Filled with the mingled beverage, with sap and vigour hath it
    come.
 [1000603]What though the strong-armed carpenter have cleft thee with
    his hand and axe.
   Pure animating waters shall cleanse thee and make thee bright
    again.
 [1000604]This Amulet, decked with chain of gold, shall give faith,
    sacrifice, and might, and dwell as guest within our house.
 [1000605]To this we give apportioned food, clarified butter, wine, and
    meath.
   May it provide each boon for us as doth a father for his sons. [p. 18]
   Again, again, from morn to morn, having approached the
    deities.

   This yields the two Physicians might, again, etc.

 [1000616]Wearing this Amulet the Gods conquered in battle all the
    worlds.

   This salutary Amulet the Deities assumed and wore. [p. 19]
   This yieldeth them the universe, again, again, from morn to
    morn. With this subdue thine enemies.
 [1000618]The seasons formed that Amulet, the Groups of Seasons fashion-
    ed it.
   The Year having constructed it preserveth everything that is.
 [1000619]The regions of the heaven, the points that lie between them
    fashioned it.
   Created by Prajapati, may the Charm cast my foemen down.

    is. With this do thou subdue thy foes.

    prosperities.
 [1000629]That Amulet may the Deities bestow on me to win success,
   The conquering, strength-increasing Charm, the damager of
    enemies.
 [1000630]I bind on me my happy fate with holy prayer and energy.
   Foeless destroyer of the foe, it hath subdued mine enemies. [p. 20]
 [1000631]May this Chaim, offspring of the Gods, make me superior to my
    foe.
   So may this charm whose milk expressed these three worlds
    longingly await,
   Be fastened on me here, that it may crown me with surpassing
    power.
 [1000632]The Charm to which men, Fathers, Gods look ever for their
    maintenance,
   May this be fastened on me here, to crown me with surpassing
    power
 [1000633]As, when the plough hath tilled the soil, the seed springs up in.
    fertile land,
   Let cattle, progeny, and food of every kind spring up with me.
 [1000634]Charm, forwarder of sacrifice, who hast a hundred priestly fees.
   Speed to preeminence him to whom I have attached thy happy
    fate.
 [1000635]Love thou, O Agni, pleased with burnt oblations, this sacred
    fuel that is ranged in order.
   In him may we find grace and loving-kindness, happiness,
    progeny, and sight and cattle, in Jatavedas kindled with
    devotion.

HYMN VII

  

Skambha, the Pillar or Fulcrum of all existence

[1000701]Which of his members is the seat of Fervour: Which is the base
    of Ceremonial Order? [p. 21]
   Where in him standeth Faith? Where Holy Duty? Where, in
    what part of him is truth implanted?
 [1000702]Out of which member glows the light of Agni? Form which
    proceeds the breath of Matarisvan?
   From which doth Chandra measure out his journey, travelling
    over Skambha's mighty body?
 [1000703]Which of his members is the earth's upholder? Which gives the
    middle air a base to rest on?
   Where, in which member is the sky established? Where hath
    the space above the sky its dwelling?
 [1000704]Whitherward yearning blazeth Agni upward? Whitherward
    yearning bloweth Matarisvan?
   Who out of many, tell me, is that Skambha to whom with long-
    ing go the turning pathways?
 [1000705]Whitheward go the half-months, and, accordant with the full
    year, the months in their procession?
   Who out of many, tell me, is that Skambha to whom go seasons
    and the groups of seasons?
 [1000706]Whitherward yearning speed the two young Damsels, accordant,
   Day and Night, of different colour?
   Who out of many, tell me, is that Skambha to whom the Waters
    take their way with longing?
 [1000707]Who out of many, tell me, is that Skambha,
   On whom Prajapati set up and firmly stablished all the worlds?
 [1000708]That universe which Prajapati created, wearing all forms,, the
    highest, midmost, lowest,
   How far did Skambha penetrate within it? What portion did
    he leave unpenetrated?
 [1000709]How far within the past hath Skambha entered? How much of
    him hath reached into the future?
   That one part which he set in thousand places,--how far did
   Skambha penetrate within it?
 [1000710]Who out of many, tell me, is that Skambha in whom men
    recognize the Waters, Brahma,
   In whom they know the worlds and their enclosures, in whom
    are non-existence and existence?
 [1000711]Declare that. Skambha, who is he of many,
   In whom, exerting every power, Fervour maintains her loftiest
    vow; [p. 22]
   In whom are comprehended Law, Waters, Devotion and Belief
 [1000712]Who out of many, tell me, is that Skambha
   On whom as their foundation earth and firmament and sky are
    set;
   In whom as their appointed place rest Fire and Moon and Sun
    and Wind?
 [1000713]Who out of many, tell me, is that Skambha
   He in whose body are contained all three-and-thirty Deities?
 [1000714]Who out of many, tell me, is that Skambha.
   In whom the Sages earliest born, the Richas, Saman, Yajus,
   Earth, and the one highest Sage abide?
 [1000715]Who out of many, tell me, is the Skambha.
   Who comprehendeth, for mankind, both immortality and death,
   He who containeth for mankind the gathered waters as his
    veins?
 [1000716]Who out of many, tell me, is that Skambha,
   He whose chief arteries stand there, the sky's four regions, he irk
    whom Sacrifice putteth forth its might?
 [1000717]They who in Purusha understand Brahma know Him who is.
   Supreme.
   He who knows Him who is Supreme, and he who knows the
   Lord of Life,
   These know the loftiest Power Divine, and thence know Skam-
    bha thoroughly.
 [1000718]Who out of many, tell me, is that Skambha
   Of whom Vaisvanara became the head, the Angirases his eye,
    and Yatus his corporeal parts?
 [1000719]Who out of many, tell me, is that Skambha
   Whose mouth they say is Holy Lore, his tongue the Honey-
    sweetened Whip, his udder is Viraj, they say?
 [1000720]Who out of many, tell me, is that Skambha
   From whom they hewed the lichas off, from whom they
    chipped the Yajus, he
   Whose hairs are Sama-verses and his mouth the Atharvangi-
    rases?
 [1000721]Men count as 'twere a thing supreme nonentity's conspicuous
    branch;
   And lower man who serve thy branch regard it as an entity.
 [1000722]Who out of many, tell me, is that Skambha [p. 23]
   In whom Adityas dwell, in whom Rudras and Vasus are
    contained,
   In whom the future and the past and all the worlds are firmly
    set;
 [1000723]Whose secret treasure evermore the three-and thirty Gods
    protect?
   Who knoweth now the treasure which, O Deities ye watch and
    guard?
 [1000724]Where the Gods, versed in Sacred Lore, worship the loftiest
   Power Divine
   The priest who knows them face to face may be a sage who
    knows the truth.
 [1000725]Great, verily, are those Gods who sprang from non-existence
    into life.
   Further, men say that that one part of Skambha is nonentity.
 [1000726]Where Skambha generating gave the Ancient World its shape
    and form,
   They recognized that single part of Skambha as the Ancient
   World,
 [1000727]The three-and-thirty Gods within his body were disposed as
    limbs:
   Some, deeply versed in Holy Lore, some know those three-and-
    thirty Gods.
 [1000728]Men know Hiranyagarbha as supreme and inexpressible:
   In the beginning, in the midst of the world, Skambha poured
    that gold.
 [1000729]On Skambha Fervour rests, the worlds and Holy Law repose on
    him.
   Skambha, I clearly know that all of thee on Indra is imposed.
 [1000730]On Indra Fervour rests, on him the worlds and Holy Law
    recline.
   Indra, I clearly know that all of thee on Skambha findeth rest.
 [1000731]Ere sun and dawn man calls and calls one Deity by the other's
    name.
   When the Unborn first sprang into existence he reached that
    independent sovran lordship; than which aught higher never
    hath arisen.
 [1000732]Be reverence paid to him, that highest Brahma, whose base is
   Earth, his belly Air, who made the sky to be his head. [p. 24]
 [1000733]Homage to highest Brahma, him whose eye is Surya and the
   Moon who groweth young and new again, him who made
   Agni for his mouth.
 [1000734]Homage to highest Brahma, him whose two life-breathings were
    the Wind,
   The Angirases his sight: who made the regions be his means of
    sense.
 [1000735]Skambha set fast these two, the earth and heaven, Skambha
    maintained the ample air between them.
   Skambha established the six spacious regions: this whole world
   Skambha entered and pervaded.
 [1000736]Homage to highest Brahma, him who, sprung from Fervour and
    from toil,
   Filled all the worlds completely, who made Soma for himself
    alone.
 [1000737]Why doth the Wind move ceaselessly? Why doth the spirit take
    no rest?
   Why do the Waters, seeking truth, never at any time repose?
 [1000738]Absorbed in Fervour, is the mighty Being, in the world's centre,
    on the waters' surface.
   To him the Deities, one and all betake them. So stand the tree-
    trunk with the branches round it.
 [1000739]Who out of many, tell me, is that Skambha.
   To whom the Deities with hands, with feet, and voice, and ear,
    and eye.
   Present unmeasured tribute in the measured hall of sacrifice?
 [1000740]Darkness is chased away from him: he is exempt from all dist-
    ress.
   In him are all the lights, the three abiding in Prajapati.
 [1000741]He verily who knows the Reed of Gold that stands amid the
    flood, is the mysterious Lord of Life.
 [1000742]Singly the two young Maids of different colours approach the
    six-pegged warp in turns and weave it.
   The one draws out the threads, the other lays them: they break
    them not, they reach no end of labour.
 [1000743]Of these two, dancing round as 'twere, I cannot distinguish
    whether ranks before the other.
   A Male in weaves this web, a Male divides it: a Male hath
    stretched it to the cope of heaven [p. 25]
 [1000744]These pegs have buttressed up the sky. The Samans have turned
    them into shuttles for the weaving.

HYMN VIII

  

Speculations on the Supreme Being and Cosmogonical and theological subjects

[1000801]Worship to loftiest Brahma, Lord of what hath been and what
    shall be,
   To him who rules the universe, and heavenly light is all his own!
 [1000802]Upheld by Skambha's power these two, the heaven and the earth,
    stand fast.
   Skambha is all this world of life, whatever breathes or shuts an.
    eye.
 [1000803]Three generations have gone by and vanished and others near
    have entered into sunlight.
   There stood on high he who metes out the region into green,
    plants hath passed the Golden-coloured.
 [1000804]One is the wheel, the tires are twelve in number, the naves are
    three What man hath understood it?
   Three hundred spokes have thereupon been hammered, and sixty
    pins set firmly in their places. [p. 28]
 [1000805]Discern thou this, O Savitar. Six are the twins, one singly born.
   They claim relationship in that among them which is born alone.
 [1000806]Though manifest, it lies concealed in the vast place they call the
    old:
   Therein is firmly stationed all the moving, breathing universe.
 [1000807]Up, eastward downward in the west, 'it rolleth, with countless
    elements, one-wheeled, single-fellied.
   With half it hath begotten all creation. Where hath the other half
    become unnoticed?
 [1000813]In front of these the five-horsed car moves onward: side-horses,
    harnessed with the others draw it.
   No one hath seen its hither course untravelled; the height sees
    it more near, the depth more distant.
 [1000809]The bowl with mouth inclined and bottom upward holds stored
    within it every form of glory.
   Thereon together sit the Seven Rishis who have become this
    mighty One's protectors
 [1000810]The Verse employed at opening and conclusion, the Verse
    employed in each and every portion;
   That by which sacrifice proceedeth onward. I ask thee which is
    that of all the Verses.
 [1000811]That which hath power of motion, that which flies, or stands,
    which breathes or breathes not, which, existing, shuts the eye
   Wearing all forms that entity upholds the earth, and in its close
    consistence still is only one.
 [1000812]The infinite to every side extended, the finite and the infinite
    around us,
   These twain Heaven's Lord divides as he advances, knowing the
    past hereof and all the future
 [1000813]Within the womb Prajapati is moving: he, though unseen, is
    born in sundry places.
   He with one half engendered all creation. What sign is there to
    tell us of the other?
 [1000814]All men behold him with the eye, but with the mind they know
    not him.
   Holding aloft the water as a water-bearer in her jar.
 [1000815]With the full vase he dwells afar, is left far off what time it fails,
   A mighty Being in creation's centre: to him the rulers of the
    realms bring tribute. [p. 29]
 [1000816]That, whence the Sun arises, that whither he goes to take his
    rest,
   That verily I hold supreme: naught in the world surpasses it.
 [1000817]Those who in recent times, midmost, or ancient, on all sides.
    greet the sage who knows the Veda,
   One and all, verily discuss Aditya, the second Agni, and the
    threefold Hansa.
 [1000818]This gold-hued Haiisa's wings, flying to heaven, spread o'er a
    thousand days' continued journey.
   Supporting all the Gods upon his bosom, he goes his way behol-
    ding every creature.
 [1000819]By truth he blazes up aloft by Brahma, he looks down below:
   He breathes obliquely with his breath, he on whom what is.
    highest rests.
 [1000820]The sage who knows the kindling-sticks whence by attrition
    wealth is drawn,
   Will comprehend what is most high, will know the mighty
   Brahmana.
 [1000821]Footless at first was he produced, footless he brought celestial
    light.
   Four-footed grown, and meet for use, he seized each thing
    enjoyable.
 [1000822]Useful will he become, and then will he consume great store of
    food
   The man who humbly worshippeth the eternal and victorious
   God.
 [1000823]Him too they call eternal; he may become new again to-day.
   Day and Night reproduce themselves, each from the form the
    other wears.
 [1000824]A hundred, thousand, myriad, yea a hundred million stores of
    wealth that passes count are laid in him.
   This wealth they kill as he looks on, and now this God shines
    bright therefrom.
 [1000825]One is yet finer than a hair, one is not even visible. And hence
    the Deity who grasps with firmer hold is dear to me.
 [1000826]This fair one is untouched by age, immortal in a mortal's house.
   He for whom she was made lies low, and he who formed her
    hath grown old.
 [1000827]Thou art a woman, and a man; thou art a damsel and a boy. [p. 30]
   Grown old thou totterest with a staff, new-born thou lookest
    every way.
 [1000828]Either the sire or son of these, the eldest or the youngest child.
   As sole God dwelling in the mind, first born, he still is in the
    womb.
 [1000829]Forth from the full he lifts the full, the full he sprinkles with
    the full.
   Now also may we know the source from which the stream is
    sprinkled round.
 [1000830]Brought forth in olden time, the everlasting, high over all that
    is was she, the Ancient.
   The mighty Goddess of the Morn, refulgent with one eye, looketh
    round with one that winketh,
 [1000831]Known by the name of Guardian Grace the Deity sits girt by
   Right.
   The trees have taken from her hue, green-garlanded, their robe
    of green.
 [1000832]When he is near she leaves him not, she sees him not though he
    is near.
   Behold the wisdom of the God; he hath not died, he grows not
    old.
 [1000833]Voices that never were before emitted speak as fitteth them.
   Whither they go and speak, they say there is the mighty Brah-
    mana.
 [1000834]I ask thee where the waters' flower by wondrous magic art was
    placed,
   Thereon the Gods and men are set as spokes are fastened in the
    nave.
 [1000835]Who gave command unto the wind that blowet!
   Who ranged the five united heavenly regions?
   Who were the Gods who cared not for oblations!
   Which of them brought the sacrificial waters?
 [1000836]One God inhabiteth the earth we live on; another hath encom-
    passed air's mid-region.
   One, the Supporter, takes the heaven and bears it: some keep-
    ing watch guard all the quarters safely.
 [1000837]The man who knows the drawn-out string on which these crea-
    tures all are strung,
   The man who knows the thread's thread, he may know the
    mighty Brahmana. [p. 31]
 [1000838]I know the drawn-out string, the thread whereon these creatures
    all are strung.
   I know the thread's thread also, thus I know the mighty Brah-
    ma na.
 [1000839]When Agni passed between the earth and heaven devouring with
    his flame the all-consumer,
   Where dwelt afar the spouses of one husband, where at that
    moment, where was Matarisvan?
   -40. Into the floods had Matarisvan entered, the deities had past in-
    to the waters.
   There stood the mighty measurer of the region: into the ver-
    dant plants went Pavamana.
 [1000841]Over the Gayatri, above the immortal world he strode away.
   Those who by Song discovered Song--where did the Unborn see
    that thing?
 [1000842]Luller to rest, and gatherer-up of treasures, Savitar like a God
    whose laws are constant, hath stood like Indra in the war for
    riches.
 [1000843]Men versed in sacred knowledge know that living Being that
    abides.
   In the nine-portalled Lotus Flower, enclosed with triple bands
    and bonds.
 [1000844]Desireless, firm, immortal, self-existent, contented with the es-
    sence, lacking nothing,
   Free from the fear of Death is he who knoweth that Soul cou-
    rageous, youthful, undecaying.

The Sataudana or Hundredfold Oblation

[1000901]Binding the mouths of those who threaten mischief, against my
    rivals cast this bolt of thunder,
   Indra first gave the Hundredfold Oblation, welfare of him who
    worships, foe-destroying.
 [1000902]Thy skin shall be the Altar; let thine hair become the Sacred
   Grass.
   This cord hath held thee firmly: let this pressing-stone dance
    round on thee:
 [1000903]The holy water be thy hair: let thy tongue make thee clean, O
   Cow.
   Go, Hundredfold Oblation, made bright and adorable, to hea-
    ven. [p. 34]
 [1000904]He who prepares the Hundredfold Oblation gains each wish
    thereby:
   For all his ministering priests, contented, move as fitteth them.
 [1000905]He rises up to heaven, ascends to younder third celestial
    height.
   Whoever gives the Hundredfold Oblation with the central
    cake.
 [1000906]That man completely wins those worlds, both of the heavens
    and of the earth,
   Whoever pays the Hundredfold. Oblation with its golden light.
 [1000907]Thine Immolators, Goddess! and the men who dress thee for
    the feast, all these will guard thee, Hundredfold Oblation!
   Have no fear of them.
 [1000908]The Vasus from the South will be thy guards, the Maruts from
    the North,
   Adityas from the West; o'ertake and pass the Agnishtoma,
    thou!
 [1000909]The Gods, the Fathers, mortal men, Gandharvas, and Apsara-
    ses,
   All these will be the guards: o'ertake and pass the Atiratra,
    thou!
 [1000910]The man who pays the Hundredfold Oblation winneth all the
    worlds,
   Air, heaven, and earth, Adityas, and Maruts, and regions of the
    sky.
 [1000911]Sprinkling down fatness, to the Gods will the beneficent God-
    dess go.
   Harm not thy dresser, Cow! To heaven, O Hundredfold Obla-
    tion, speed!
 [1000912]From all the Gods enthroned in heaven, in air, from those who
    dwell on earth,
   Draw forth for evermore a stream of milk, of butter, and of
    mead.
 [1000913]Let thy head, let thy mouth, let both thine ears, and those two
    jaws of thine.
   Pour for the giver mingled curd, and flowing butter, milk, and
    mead.
 [1000914]Let both thy lips, thy nostrils, both thy horns, and these two
    eyes of thine. [p. 35]
   Pour for the given, etc.
 [1000915]Let heart and pericardium, let thy lungs with all the bronchial
    tubes, etc.
 [1000916]Let liver, and let kidneys, let thine entrails, and the parts within,
    etc.
 [1000917]Let rectum and omentum, let thy belly's hollows, and thy skin,
    etc.
 [1000918]Let all thy marrow, every bone, let all thy flesh, and all thy
    blood, etc.
 [1000919]Let both thy shoulders and thy hump, thy forelegs, and their
    lower parts, etc.
 [1000920]Let neck and nape and shoulder-joints, thy ribs and inter-costal
    parts, etc.
 [1000921]So let thy thighs and thy knee-bones, thy hinder quarters, and
    thy hips, etc.
 [1000922]So let thy tail and all the hairs thereof, thine udder, and thy
    teats, etc.
 [1000923]Let all thy legs, the refuse of thy feet, thy heelropes, and thy
    hooves.
   Pour for the giver mingled curd, and flowing butter milk, and
    mead.
 [1000924]Let all thy skin, Sataudana! let every hair thou hast, O Cow,
   Pour for the giver mingled curd, and flowing butter, milk, and
    mead.
 [1000925]Sprinkled with molten butter, let the two meal-cakes be sport
    for thee.
   Make them thy wings, O Goddess, and bear him who dresses
    thee to heaven.
 [1000926]Each grain of rice in mortar or on pestle, all on the skin or in
    the winnowing-basket,
   Whatever purifying Matarisvan, the Wind, hath sifted, let the
   Hotar Agni make of it an acceptable oblation.
 [1000927]In the priest's hands I lay, in separate order, the sweet celestial
   Waters, dropping fatness.
   As here I sprinkle them may all my wishes be granted unto me
    in perfect fulness. May we have ample wealth in our posses-
    sion.

HYMN X

  

A glorification of the sacred Cow as representing the radiant heavens

[1001001]Worship to thee springing to life, and worship unto thee when
    born!
   Worship, O Cow, to thy tail-hair, and to thy hooves, and to thy
    form!
 [1001002]The man who knows the Seven Floods, who knows the seven
    distances,
   Who knows the head of sacrifice, he may receive the holy Cow.
 [1001003]I know the Seven Water-floods, I know the seven distances,
   I know the head of sacrifice, and Soma shining bright in her.
 [1001004]Hitherward we invite with prayer the Cow who pours a thou-
    sand streams,
   By whom the heaven, by whom the earth, by whom these waters
    are preserved.
 [1001005]Upon her back there are a hundred keepers, a hundred metal
    bowls, a hundred milkers.
   The Deities who breathe in her all separately know the Cow. [p. 37]
 [1001006]Her foot is sacrifice, her milk libation, Svadha her breath, Mahi-
    luka the mighty:
   To the God goes with prayer the Cow who hath Parjanya for
    her lord.
 [1001007]Agni hath entered into thee; Soma, O Cow, hath entered thee.
   Thine udder is Parjanya, O blest Cow; the lightnings are thy
    teats.
 [1001008]Thou pourest out the Waters first, and corn-lands afterward,
   O Cow.
   Thirdly thou pourest princely sway. O Cow, thou pourest food
    and milk.
 [1001009]When, Holy One, thou camest nigh invited by the Adityas' call,
   Indra gave thee to drink, O cow, a thousand bowls of Soma
    juice.
 [1001010]The Bull, what time thou followedst the way of Indra, summon-
    ed thee:
   Thence the Fiend-slayer, angered, took thy water and thy milk
    away.
 [1001011]O Cow, the milk which in his wrath the Lord of Riches took
    from thee,
   That same the vault of heaven now preserveth in three reser-
    voirs.
 [1001012]The Cow Celestial received that Soma in three vessels, where.
   Atharvan, consecrated, sate upon the Sacred Grass of gold.
 [1001013]Come hither with the Soma, come with every footed thing; the
   Cow
   With Kalis and Gandharvas by her side hath stepped upon the
    sea.
 [1001014]Come hither with the Wind, yea, come with every creature borne
    on wings.
   Laden with holy verse and song the Cow hath leapt into the
    sea.
 [1001015]Come with the Sun, come hitherward with every creature that
    hath eyes,
   Bearing auspicious lights with her the Cow hath looked across
    the sea.
 [1001016]When, covered round about with gold, thou stoodest there, O
   Holy One,
   The ocean turned into a horse and mounted on thy back, O
   Cow, [p. 38]
 [1001017]Then came and met the Blessed Ones, Deshtri, the Cow, and
   Svadha, where
   Atharvan, consecrated. sate upon the Sacred Grass of gold.
 [1001018]The Kshatriya's mother is the Cow, thy mother, Svadha! is the
   Cow.
   Sacrifice is the weapon of the Cow: the thought arose from,
    her.
 [1001019]From Brahma's summit there went forth a drop that mounted
    up on high:
   From that wast thou produced, O Cow, from that the Hotar
    sprang to life.
 [1001020]Forth from thy mouth the Gathas came, from thy neck's nape
    sprang strength, O Cow.
   Sacrifice from thy flanks was born, and rays of sunlight from.
    thy teats,
 [1001021]From thy fore-quarters and thy thighs motion was generated,
   Cow!
   Food from thine entrails was produced, and from thy belly came
    the plants.
 [1001022]When into Varuna's belly thou hadst found a passage for thy-
    self,
   The Brahman called thee thence, for he knew how to guide and
    lead thee forth.
 [1001023]All trembled at the babe that came from him who brings not to
    the birth.
   He hath produced her--thus they cried--He is a cow, and formed
    by spells, he hath become skin to her.
 [1001024]He only joineth battle, yea, he who alone controlleth her.
   Now sacrifices have become victories, and the Cow their eye.
 [1001025]The Cow hath welcomed sacrifice: the Cow hath held the Sun
    in place.
   Together with the prayer the mess of rice hath passed into the
   Cow.
 [1001026]They call the Cow immortal life, pay homage to the Cow as
   Death.
   She hath become this universe, Fathers, and Rishis, hath become
    the Gods, and men, and Asuras.
 [1001027]The man who hath this knowledge may receive the Cow with.
    welcoming. [p. 39]
   So for the giver willingly doth perfect sacrifice pour milk.
 [1001028]Within the mouth of Varuna three tongues are glittering with
    light.
   That which shines midmost of them is this Cow most difficult to
    hold.
 [1001029]Four-parted was the Cow's prolific humour.
   One-fourth is Water, one-fourth life eternal, one-fourth is sacri-
    fice, one-fourth are cattle.
 [1001030]The Cow is Heaven, the Cow is Earth, the Cow is Vishnu, Lord
    of Life.
    e The Sadhyas and the Vasus have drunk the out-pourings of the
   Cow.
 [1001031]When these, Sadhyas and Vasus, have drunk the out-pourings of
    the Cow,
   They in the Bright One's dwelling-place pay adoration to her
    milk.
 [1001032]For Soma some have milked her: some worship the fatness she
    hath poured.
   They who have given a cow to him who hath this knowledge
    have gone up to the third region of the sky.
 [1001033]He who hath given a Cow unto the Brahmans winneth all the
    worlds.
   For Right is firmly set in her devotion, and religious zeal.
 [1001034]Both Gods and mortal men depend for life and being on the
   Cow.
   She hath become this universe: all that the Sun surveys is she.

HYMN I

  

An accompaniment to the preparation and presentation of a Brahmaudana

[1100101]Agni, spring forth! Here Aditi, afflicted, cooks a Brahmaudana,
    yearning for children.
   Let the Seven Rishis, World-creators, rub thee into existence
    here with gift of offspring.
 [1100102]Raise, as I bid, the smoke, my strong companions, lovers of free-
    dom from deceit and malice!
   Victor in fight heroic, here is Agni by whom the Gods subdued
    the hostile demons.
 [1100103]Thou, Agni, wart produced for mighty valour, to cook Brahmau-
    dana, O Jatavedas.
   Seven Rishis, makers of the world, begat thee, Grant to this
    woman wealth with store of heroes.
 [1100104]Burn up, O Agni, kindled with the fuel. Knowing the Gods who
    merit worship, bring them.
   Cooking, for these, oblation, Jatavedas! lift up this man to
    heaven's most lofty summit.
 [1100105]Your portion from of old is triply parted, portion of Gods, of
   Fathers, and of mortals.
   Know, all, your shares. I deal them out among you. The portion
    of the Gods shall save this woman.
 [1100106]Strong art thou, Agni, conquering, all-surpassing. Crush down
    our foemen, ruin those who hate us.
   So let this measure, measured, being measured, make all our kin
    thy tributary vassals.
 [1100107]Increase with kinsmen and with all abundance: to mighty strength
    and power lift up this woman.
   Erect, rise upward to the sky's high station, rise to the lofty
    world which men call Svarga.
 [1100108]May this great Earth receive the skin, this Goddess Prithivi,
    showing us her love and favour. Then may we go unto the
    world of virtue. [p. 42]
 [1100109]Fix on the skin these two joined press-stones, duly rending the
    fibres for the sacrificer.
   Strike down and slay those who assail this woman, and elevating
    raise on high her offspring.
 [1100110]Grasp with thy hand, O man, the well-formed press-stones: the
    holy Gods have come unto thy worship.
   Three wishes of thy heart which thou electest, these happy gains
    for thee I here make ready.
 [1100111]Here thy devotion is, here is thy birthplace. Aditi, Mother of
    brave sons, accept thee!
   Wipe away those who fight against this woman with wealth and
    store of goodly sons endow her.
 [1100112]Rest in the roaring frame of wood: be parted from husk and
    chaff, ye Sacrificial Fibres.
   May we surpass in glory all our rivals. I cast beneath my feet
    the men who hate us.
 [1100113]Go, Dame, and quickly come again: the waters, enclosed, have
    mounted thee that thou mayst bear them.
   Take thou of these such as are fit for service: skilfully separating.
    leave the others.
 [1100114]Hither these Dames have come in radiant beauty. Arise and seize=
    upon thy strength, O woman.
   To thee hath sacrifice come: take the pitcher, blest with a good
    lord, children, children's children.
 [1100115]Instructed by the Rishis, bring those waters, the share of strength
    which was of old assigned you.
   Let this effectual sacrifice afford you protection, fortune, off-
    spring, men, and cattle.
 [1100116]Agni, on thee the sacrificial caldron hath mounted: shining,.
    fiercely flaming, heat it.
   May hottest flames, divine, sprung from the Rishis, gathering,
    with the Seasons, heat this portion.
 [1100117]Purified, bright, and holy, let these Women, these lucid waters
    glide into the caldron.
   Cattle and many children may they give us. May he who cooks.
    the Odana go to heaven.
 [1100118]Ye, Sacrificial Rice and Soma Fibres, cleansed and made pure by
    prayer and molten butter. [p. 43]
   Enter the water: let the caldron take you. May he who dresses
    this ascend to heaven.
 [1100119]Expand thyself abroad in all thy greatness, with thousand Prish-
    thas, in the world of virtue.
   Grandfathers, fathers, children, and descendants, fifteenth am I
    to thee when I have dressed it.
 [1100120]With thousand streams and Prishthas, undecaying, Brahmaudana
    is celestial, God-reaching.
   Those I give up to thee with all their children. Force them to
    tribute, but to me be gracious.
 [1100121]Rise to the altar: bless this dame with offspring. Promote this
    woman; drive away the demons.
   May we surpass in glory all our rivals. I cast beneath my feet the
    men who hate us.
 [1100122]Approach this woman here with store of cattle: together with
    the deities come to meet her.
   Let not a curse or imprecation reach thee: in thine own seat
    shine forth exempt from sickness.
 [1100123]Fashioned at first by Right, set by the spirit, this altar of Brahmau-
    dana was appointed.
   Place the pure boiler on it, woman! set thou therein the rice
    mess of Celestial Beings.
 [1100124]This second hand of Aditi, this ladle which the Seven Rishis,
    world-creators, fashioned.
   May this scoop deftly pile upon the altar, therein, the members
    of the rice-oblation.
 [1100125]Let the dressed offering and divine Ones serve thee: creep from.
    the fire again, own these as masters.
   Made pure with Soma rest within the Brahmans: let not thine
    eaters, Rishis' sons, be injured.
 [1100126]Give understanding unto these, King Soma! all the good Brah
    mans who attend and serve thee.
   Oft, in Brahmaudana, and well I call on: Rishis, their sons, and
    those who sprang from Fervour.
 [1100127]Here I set singly in the hands of Brahmans these cleansed and.
    purifie d and holy Women,
   May Indra, Marut girt, grant me the blessing which as I sprinkle
    you, my heart desireth.
 [1100128]Here is my gold, a light immortal: ripened grain from the field
    this Cow of Plenty give me! [p. 44]
   This wealth I place among the Brahmans, making a path that
    leads to heaven among the Fathers.
 [1100129]Lay thou the chaff in Agni Jatavedas: remove the husks and
    drive them to a distance.
   That, we have heard, that is the House-Lord's portion: we know
    the share allotted to Destruction.
 [1100130]Mark him who toils and cooks and pours oblation: make this
    man climb the path that leads to heaven,
   That he may mount and reach life that is highest, ascending to
    the loftiest vault above us.
 [1100131]Adhvaryu, cleanse that face of the Supporter. Make room, well
    knowing, for the molten butter.
   Purify duly all the limbs with fatness. I make a path to heaven
    amid the Fathers.
 [1100132]Supporter, send to those men fiends and battle, to all non-Brah-
    mans who attend and serve thee.
   Famous and foremost, with their great possessions, let not these
    here, the Rishis sons, be injured.
 [1100133]I set thee, Odana, with Rishis' children: naught here belongs to
    men not sprung from Rishis.
   Let Agni my protector, all the Maruts, the Visve Devas guard
    the cooked oblation.
 [1100134]May we adore thee, Sacrifice that yieldeth an everlasting son,
    cow, home of treasures,
   Together with increasing store of riches, long life and immor-
    tality of children.
 [1100135]Thou art a Bull that mounts to heaven: to Rishis and their off-
    spring go.
   Rest in the world of pious men: there is the place prepared for
    us.
 [1100136]Level the ways: go thitherward, O Agni. Make ready thou the
   Godward-leading pathways.
   By these our pious actions may we follow sacrifice dwelling in
    the seven-rayed heaven.
 [1100137]May we invested with that light go upward, ascending to the
    sky's most lofty summit.
   Wherewith the Gods, what time they had made ready
   Brahmaudana, mounted to the world of virtue.

HYMN II

  

Prayer and praise to Bhava, Sarva and Rudra

[1100201]Bhava and Sarva, spare us, be not hostile. Homage to you, twin
   Lords of beasts and spirits!
   Shoot not the arrow aimed and drawn against us: forbear to
    harm our quadrupeds and bipeds.
 [1100202]Cast not our bodies to the dog or jackal, nor, Lord of Beasts!
    to carrion-kites or vultures.
   Let not thy black voracious flies attack them; let not thy birds
    obtain them for their banquet.
 [1100203]We offer homage to thy shout, Bhava! thy breath, thy racking
    pains:
   Homage, Immortal One! to thee, to Rudra of the thousand
    eyes.
 [1100204]We offer reverence to thee from eastward, and from north and
    south,
   From all the compass of the sky, to thee and to the firmament.
 [1100205]Homage, O Bhava, Lord of Beasts, unto thy face and all thine
    eyes,
   To skin, and hue, and aspect, and to thee when looked at from
    behind!
 [1100206]We offer homage to thy limbs, thy belly, and thy tongue, and
    mouth we offer homage to thy smell.
 [1100207]Never may we contend with him, the mighty archer, thousand-
    eyed. [p. 47]
   Rudra who wears black tufts of hair, the slaughterer of
   Ardhaka.
 [1100208]May he, may Bhava from all sides avoid us, avoid us even as
    fire avoids the waters. Let him not threaten us. To him be
    homage!
 [1100209]Four times, eight times be homage paid to Bhava, yea, Lord of
   Beasts, ten times be reverence paid thee!
   Thine are these animals, five several classes, oxen, and goats and
    sheep, and men, and horses
 [1100210]Thine the four regions, thine are earth and heaven, thine,
   Mighty One, this firmament between them;
   Thine everything with soul and breath here on the surface of the
    land.
 [1100211]Thine is this ample wealth-containing storehouse that holds with-
    in it all these living creatures.
   Favour us, Lord of Beasts, to thee be homage! Far from us go
    ill-omens, dogs, and jackals, and wild-haired women with
    their horrid shrieking!
 [1100212]A yellow bow of gold thou wieldest, slaying its hundred, tufted
   God! smiting its thousand.
   Weapon of Gods, far flies the shaft of Rudra: wherever it may
    be, we pay it homage.
 [1100213]Thou, Rudra, followest close the foe who lies in wait to conquer
    thee.
   Even as a hunter who pursues the footsteps of the wounded
    game.
 [1100214]Accordant and allies, Bhava and Rudra, with mighty strength ye
    go to deeds of valour. Wherever they may be, we pay them
    homage.
 [1100215]Be homage, Rudra, unto thee approaching and departing hence!
   Homage to thee when standing still, to thee when seated and at
    rest!
 [1100216]Homage at evening and at morn, homage at night, homage by
    day .
   To Bhava and to Sarva, both, have I paid lowly reverence,
 [1100217]Let us not outrage with our tongue far-seeing Rudra, thousand-
    eyed,
   Inspired with varied lore, who shoots his arrows forward, far
    away. [p. 48]
 [1100218]Foremost we go to meet his car, the chariot of the long-haired
   God,
   Drawn by brown horses, dusky, black, o'erthrowing, slaying,
    terrible. Let reverence be paid to him.
 [1100219]Cast not thy club at us, thy heavenly weapon. Lord of Beasts,
    be not wroth with us. Let reverence be paid to thee.
   Shake thy celestial branch above some others elsewhere, not o'er
    us.
 [1100220]Do us no harm, but comfort us: avoid thou us, and be not
    wroth. Never let us contend with thee.
 [1100221]Covet not thou our kine or men, covet not thou our goats or
    sheep.
   Elsewhither, strong One! turn thine aim: destroy the mockers'
    family.
 [1100222]Homage to him whose weapon, Cough or Fever, assails one like
    the neighing of a stallion; to him who draws one forth and
    then another!
 [1100223]Homage be paid him with ten Sakvari verses who stands
    established in the air's mid-region, slaying non-sacrificing
   God-despisers!
 [1100224]For thee were forest beasts and sylvan creatures placed in the
    wood, and small birds, swans, and eagles.
   Floods, Lord of Beasts! contain thy living beings: to swell thy
    strength flow the celestial Waters.
 [1100225]Porpoises, serpents, strange aquatic monsters, fishes, and things
    unclean at which thou shootest.
   Nothing is far for thee, naught checks thee, Bhava! The whole
    earth in a moment thou surveyest. From the east sea thou
    smitest in the northern.
 [1100226]O'erwhelm us not with Fever or with poison, nor, Rudra! with
    the fire that comes from heaven. Elsewhere, and not on us,
    cast down this lightning.
 [1100227]Ruler of heaven and Lord of earth is Bhava: Bhava hath filled
    the spacious air's mid-region. Where'er he be, to him be paid
    our homage!
 [1100228]King Bhava, favour him who offers worship, for thou art
   Pasupati, Lord of victims.
   Be gracious to the quadruped and biped of the believer in the
   Gods' existence. [p. 49]
 [1100229]Harm thou among us neither great nor little, not one who bears
    us, not our future bearers.
   Injure no sire among us, harm no mother. Forbear to injure our
    own bodies, Rudra.
 [1100230]This lowly reverence have I paid to Rudra's dogs with mighty
    mouths,
   Hounds terrible with bark and howl, who gorge unmasticated
    food.
 [1100231]Homage to thy loud-shouting hosts and thy long-haired
    followers!
   Homage to hosts that are adored, homage to armies that enjoy
   Homage to all thy troops, O God. Security and bliss be ours!

HYMN III

  

A glorification of the Odana or oblation of boiled rice

   [1100301]1. Of that Odana Brihaspati is the head, Brahma the mouth.
    [1100302]2. Heaven and Earth are the ears, the Sun and Moon are the
    eyes, the seven Rishis are the vital airs inhaled and exhaled. [p. 50]
    3. Vision is the pestle, Desire the mortar. 4. Diti is the
    winnowing basket, Aditi is she who holds it, Vata is the sifter.
    5. Horses are the grains, oxen the winnowed ricegrains, gnats
    the husks. 6. Kabru is the husked grain, the rain cloud is the
    reed. 7. Grey iron is its flesh, copper its blood. 8. Tin is its
    ashes, gold its colour, the blue lotus flower its scent. 9. The
    threshing-floor is its dish, the wooden swords its shoulders,
    the car-shafts its backbones. 10. Collar-bones are its entrails,
    straps its intestines. 11. This earth, verily becomes the jar,
    and heaven the cover of the Odana as it is cooking.
    12. Furrows are its ribs, sandy soils the undigested contents
    of its stomach. 13. Law is its water for the hands and family
    custom its aspersion. 14. The jar covered with the Rich has
    been solemnly directed by the priestly office. 15. Received by
    the Brahman, it has been carried round. 16. The Brihat is,
    the stirring-spoon, the Rathantara the ladle. 17. The Seasons
    are the dressers, the Groups of Seasons kindle the fire.
    18. The caldron flames round the oblation (charu) whose
    mouth consists of five openings.
    [1100319]19. The sacrificial word, all worlds are to be won with Odana.
    [1100320]20. Whereon in order rest the three, the ocean, and the heaven, and
    earth.
    [1100321]21. Within the residue whereof the Gods arranged six eightieth
    parts--
    [1100322]22. I ask thee, of this Odana what is the mighty magnitude.
    [1100323]23. He who may know the magnitude of the Odana. 24. Would say,
   Not small, nor devoid of moistening sauce; not this, nor any-
    thing whatever. 25. He would not declare it to be greater than
    the giver imagines it to be. 26. The theologians say, Thou
    hast eaten the averted Odana and the Odana turned hither-
    ward. 27. Thou hast eaten the Odana and the Odana will eat
    thee. 28. Thou hast eaten this averted; thy inward breath will
    leave thee; so he said to this one. 29. Thou hast eaten this
    turned hitherward; thy downward breath will leave thee; so
    he said to this one. 30. I indeed have not eaten the Odana,
    nor has the Odana eaten me. 31. The Odana has just eaten
    the Odana.

  

2

   [1100332]32. And thence he said to this one, Thou hast eaten this with a[p. 51]
    different head from that with which the ancient Rishis ate:
    thy offspring, reckoning from the eldest, will die. I have eaten
    it neither turned downward, nor turned away, nor turned
    hitherward. With Brihaspati as head: with him I have eaten,
    with him have I come to it. Now this Odana is complete with
    all members, joints, and body. Complete, verily, with all his
    members, joints, and body is he who possess this knowledge.
    33. And thence he said to him, Thou hast eaten this with
    other ears than those with which the ancient Rishis ate it.
    Thou wilt be deaf. I have eaten it neither, etc. (as in verse 32).
    With Heaven and Earth as ears, with these I have eaten it,
    with these I have come to it. Now this Odana, etc. (as in 32).
    34. And thence he said to him. Thou hast eaten this with
    other eyes . . . thou wilt be blind. With Sun and Moon, etc.
    35. And thence, etc. . . with other month. Thy offspring will
    die, reckoning from the head . . . With Brahma as mouth.

    airs. . . . Thy vital airs will leave thee . . . With the Seven
    Rishis as the vital airs. 39. And thence, etc. . . . with other
    expanse . . . Consumption will destroy thee . . . With the
    firmament as expanse. 40 And thence, etc. . . . with other
    back. . . . Lightning will slay thee. . . With the heaven as
    back. 41. And thence, etc. . . . with other breast . . . Thou
    wilt fail in agriculture. . . . With the earth as breast. 42. And
    thence, etc. . . . with other belly . . . colic will destroy thee . . .
    With truth as belly. 43. And thence, etc. . . . with other
    abdomen . . . Thou wilt die in the water . . . With the sea as
    abdomen. 44. And thence, etc. . . . with other thighs . . .
    Thy thigh will perish . . . With Mitra-Varuna as thighs.
    45. And thence, etc. . . . with other knees . . . Thou wilt
    become a sick man . . . With the knees of Tvashtar. 46. And
    thence, etc. . . . with other feet . . . Thou wilt become a
    wanderer . . . With the feet of the Asvins. 47. And thence,
    etc. . . with other fore-parts of the feet . . . A serpent will
    kill thee . . . With the fore-parts of Savitar's feet. 48. And
    thence, etc. . . . with other hands . . . The Brahmana (divine
    power) will kill thee . . . With the hands of Right. 49. And [p. 52]
    thence, etc. . . . with other basis . . . Without standing-ground
    and resting-place thou wilt die . . . Having taken my stand on
    truth. With this I ate it, with this I came to it. Now this
    Odana is complete with all members, joints, and body.
    Complete, verily, with all his members, joints, and body is he
    who possesses this knowledge.

HYMN IV

  

A glorification of Prana, Breath or Vital Spirit

[1100401]Homage to Prana, him who hath dominion o'er the universe,
   Who hath become the Sovran Lord of all, on whom the whole
    depends!
 [1100402]Homage, O Prana, to thy roar, to thunder-peal and lightning
    flash!
   Homage, O Prana, unto thee what time thou sendest down thy
    rain!
 [1100403]When Prana with a thunderous voice shouts his loud message
    to the plants,
   They straightway are impregnate, they conceive, and bear
    abundantly. [p. 53]
 [1100404]When the due season hath arrived and Prana shouteth to herbs,
   Then all is joyful, yea, each thing upon the surface of the earth.
 [1100405]When Prana hath poured down his flood of rain upon the
    mighty land.
   Cattle and beasts rejoice thereat: Now great will he our
    strength, they cry.
 [1100406]Watered by Prana's rain the plants have raised their voices in
    accord:
   Thou hast prolonged our life, they say, and given fragrance to us
    all.
 [1100407]Homage to thee when coming nigh, homage to thee departing
    hence!
   Homage, O Prana, be to thee when standing and when sitting
    still.
 [1100408]Homage to thee at every breath thou drawest in and sendest
    forth!
   Homage to thee when turned away, homage to thee seen face to
    face! This reverence be to all of thee!
 [1100409]Prana, communicate to us thy dear, thy very dearest form.
   Whatever healing balm thou hast, give us thereof that we may
    live.
 [1100410]Prana robes living creatures as a father his beloved son. Prana
    is sovran Lord of all, of all that breathes not, all that
    breathes
 [1100411]Prana is Fever, he is Death. Prana is worshipped by the Gods.
   Prana sets in the loftiest sphere the man who speaks the words
    of truth.
 [1100412]Prana is Deshtri, and Viraj Prana is reverenced by all. He is the
   Sun, he is the Moon. Prana is called Prajapati.
 [1100413]Both breaths are rice and barley, and Prana is called the toiling
    ox:
   In barley is the inbreath laid, and rice is named the outward
    breath.
 [1100414]The human infant in the womb draws vital breath and sends it
   Lout:
   When thou, O Prana, quickenest the babe it springs anew to
    life.
 [1100415]The name of Prana is bestowed on Matarisvan and on Wind.
   On Prana, past and future, yea, on Prana everything depends. [p. 54]
 [1100416]All herbs and plants spring forth and grow when thou, O Prana
    quickenest,
   Plants of Atharvan, Angiras, plants of the deities and men.
 [1100417]When Prana hath poured down his flood of rain upon the
    mighty earth,
   The plants are wakened into life, and every herd that grows on
    ground.
 [1100418]The man who knows this truth of thee, O Prana, and what bears
    thee up
   To him will all present their gift of tribute in that loftiest will
    all present their gift of tribute in that loftiest world.
 [1100419]As all these living creatures are thy tributaries, Prana, so
   Shall they bring tribute unto him who hears thee with attentive
    ears.
 [1100420]Filled with a babe, mid deities he wanders: grown; near at hand,
    he springs again to being.
   That Father, grown the present and the future, hath past into
    the son with mighty powers.
 [1100421]Hansa, what time he rises up, leaves in the flood one foot un-
    moved.
   If he withdrew it there would be no more tomorrow or to-day,
   Never would there be night, no more would daylight shine or
    morning flush.
 [1100422]It rolleth on, eight-wheeled and single-fellied, and with a thousand
    eyes, forward and backward.
   With one half it engendered all creation. What sign is there to
    tell us of the other?
 [1100423]Homage, O Prana unto thee armed with swift bow among the
    rest,
   In whose dominion is this All of varied sort that stirs and
    works!
 [1100424]May he who rules this Universe of varied sort, that stirs and
    works,
   Prana, alert and resolute, assist me through the prayer I pray.
 [1100425]Erect among the sleepers he wakes, and is never laid at length,
   No one hath ever heard that he hath been asleep while others
    slept.
 [1100426]Thou, Prana, never shalt be hid, never shalt be estranged from
    me.
   I bind thee on myself for life, O Prana, like the Waters' germ.

[p. 55]

  

HYMN V

  

A glorification of the Brahmachgri or religious student

[1100501]Stirring both worlds the Brahmachari moveth: in him the
    deities are all one-minded.
   He hath established firmly earth and heaven: he satisfies his
   Master with his Fervour.
 [1100502]After the Brahmachari go the Fathers, the heavenly hosts, all
   Gods in separate order.
   After him too have the Gandharvas followed, thirty and three,
    three hundred, and six thousand. He satisfies all Gods with
    his devotion.
 [1100503]The Master, welcoming his new disciple, into his bowels takes
    the Brahmachari.
   Three nights he holds and bears him in this belly. When he is
    born, the Gods convene to see him.
 [1100504]This log is earth, the second log is heaven: he fills the air's mid
    region with the fuel.
   With fuel, with his zone the Brahmachari contents the worlds,
    with labour and with Fervour.
 [1100505]The Brahmachari, earlier born than Brahma, sprang up through
   Fervour, robed in hot libation.
   From him sprang heavenly lore, the highest Brahma, and all the
   Gods, with life that lasts for ever. [p. 56]
 [1100506]Lighted by fuel goes the Brahmachari, clad in black-buck skin,
    consecrate, long-bearded.
   Swiftly he goes from east to northern ocean, grasping the worlds,
    oft bringing them anear him.
 [1100507]The Brahmachari, fathering Prayer, world, Waters, Viraj, Praja-
    pati, and Parameshthin,
   Lay as a germ within the Immortal's bosom, then became Indra
    and destroyed the demons.
 [1100508]The Master fashioned both these cloudy regions, profound and
    spacious pair, the earth and heaven.
   The Brahmachari guards them with his Fervour. In him the
    deities are all one-minded.
 [1100509]The Brahmachari first of all brought hither this ample earth as
    alms, and heaven above it.
   He makes these twain two fuel-logs, and worships, On these sup-
    ported rest all living creatures.
 [1100510]Both treasuries of sacred lore lie hidden, one hitherward, beyond
    heaven's ridge the other.
   The Brahmachari with his Fervour guards them. He makes this
    all his own as knowing Brahma.
 [1100511]Hitherward one, hence from the earth the other, two Agnis meet
    between these cloudy regions.
   Close to these two firm rays of light are clinging. The Brahma-
    chari enters them through Fervour.
 [1100512]Thundering, shouting, ruddy-hued, and pallid, he bears along the
    earth great manly vigour.
   Down on the ridge of earth the Brahmachari pours seed, and
    this gives life to heaven's four regions.
 [1100513]The Brahmachari stores with fuel Waters, and Fire, and Sun, and
   Moon, and Matarisvan.
   The Water's lights move separate in the rain-cloud, Man, rain,
    and water are their molten butter.
 [1100514]The Master is Death, Varuna, Soma, the plants of earth, and
    milk.
   The thunder-clouds were men of war. By these this heavenly
    light was brought.
 [1100515]Varuna, made a Master, takes at home the butter to himself.
   Whatever with Prajapati he sought, the Brahmachari gave like
   Mitra from his loftiest soul. [p. 57]
 [1100516]The pupil is the Master, yea, the pupil is Prajapati.
   Prajapati shines bright; the bright Viraj grew potent Indra's self.
 [1100517]By Fervour and by self-restraint the King protects the realm he
    rules.
   By self-restraint the Master seeks a Brahmachari to instruct.
 [1100518]By self-restraint a maiden finds a youth to be her wedded lord.
   By self-restraint the ox and horse seek to win fodder for them-
    selves.
 [1100519]By Fervour and by self-restraint the Gods draye Death away
    from them,
   And Indra brought by self-restraint heaven's lustre to the deities.
 [1100520]The plants, what is and what shall be, day, night, the tall tree of
    the wood,
   The year with seasons of the year, all from the Brahmachari
    sprang.
 [1100521]All creatures of the earth and heaven, tame animals and sylvan
    beasts,
   Winged and wingless creatures, from the Brahmachari sprang
    to life,
 [1100522]All children of Prajapati have breath distinctly in themselves.
   The Brahma that is stored within the Brahmachari guards them
    all.
 [1100523]Piled up on high, but never yet ascended, that power of deities
    is brightly shining.
   From that sprang heavenly lore, the loftiest Brahma, and all the
   Gods with, life that lasts for ever.
 [1100524]The Brahmachari wields the radiant Brahma wherein all Gods
    are woven close together;
   Creating breath, inhaling and exhaling, voice, mind, and heart,
   Brahma and holy wisdom.
 [1100525]Bestow on us the power of sight and hearing, glory and food and
    seed and blood and belly.
 [1100526]These, standing on the flood, the Brahmachari formed practising
    in sea his hot devotion.
   When he hath bathed, brown, yellow-hued, he shines exceedingly
    on earth.

[1100801]When Manyu brought his consort home forth from Sankalpa's
    dwelling-place,
   Who were the wooers of the bride, who was the chief who
    courted her?
 [1100802]Fervour and Action were the two, in depths of the great billowy
    sea?
   These were the wooers of the bride; Brahma the chief who
    courted her.
 [1100803]Ten Gods before the Gods were born together in the ancient
    time.
   Whoso may know them face to face may now pronounce the
    mighty word.
 [1100804]Inbreath and outbreath, eye and ear, decay and freedom from.
    decay, [p. 65]
   Spiration upward and diffused, voice, mind have brought us
    wish and plan.
 [1100805]As yet the Seasons were unborn, and Dilator and Prajapati,
   Both Asvins, Indra, Agni. Whom then did they worship as
    supreme?
 [1100806]Fervour and Action were the two, in depths of the great billowy
    sea;
   Fervour sprang up from Action: this they served and worship-
    ped as supreme.
 [1100807]He may account himself well versed in ancient time who knows
    by name.
   The earth that was before this earth, which only wisest Sages
    know.
 [1100808]From whom did Indra spring? from whom sprang Soma?
    whence was Agni born?
   From whom did Tvashtar spring to life? and whence is Dilator's
    origin?
 [1100809]Indra from Indra, Soma from Soma, Agni from Agni sprang
   Tvashtar from Tvashtar was produced, Dilator was Dhatar's
    origin.
 [1100810]Those Gods who were of old, the Ten begotten earlier than the
   Gods,
   What world do they inhabit since they gave the world unto
    their sons?
 [1100811]When he had brought together hair, sinew and bone, marrow
    and flesh.
   And to the body added feet, then to what world did he depart?
 [1100812]Whence, from what region did he bring the hair, the sinews, and
    the bones,
   Marrow and limbs, and joints, and flesh? Who was the bringer,
    and from whence?
 [1100813]Casters, those Gods were called who brought together all the
    elements:
   When they had fused the mortal man complete, they entered
    into him.
 [1100814]The thighs, the knee-bones, and the feet, the head, the face,
   Land both the hands,
   The ribs, the nipples, and the sides--what I ishi hath constructed
    that? [p. 66]
 [1100815]Head, both the hands, and face, and tongue, and neck, and inter-
    coastal parts,
   All this, investing it with skins, Mahi conjoined with bond and
    tie.
 [1100816]What time the might body lay firmly compact with tie and bond,
   Who gave its colour to the form, the hue wherewith it shines
    to-day?
 [1100817]All Deities had lent their aid: of this a noble Dame took note,
   Tsa, the Consort of Command. She gave its colour to the form.
 [1100818]When Tvashtar, Tvashtar's loftier Sire, had bored it out and
    hollowed it.
   Gods made the mortal their abode, and entered and possessed
    the man.
 [1100819]Sleep, specially, Sloth, Nirriti, and deities whose name is Sin,
   Baldness, old age, and hoary hairs within the body found their
    way.
 [1100820]Theft, evil-doing, and deceit, truth, sacrifice, exalted fame,
   Strength, princely power, and energy entered the body as a
    home.
 [1100821]Prosperity and poverty, kindnesses and malignities,
   Hunger and thirst of every kind entered the body as a home.
 [1100822]Reproaches, freedom from reproach, all blamable, all blameless
    deeds,
   Bounty, belief, and unbelief entered the body as a home.
 [1100823]All knowledge and all ignorance, each other thing that one may
    learn,
   Entered the body, prayer, and hymns, and songs, and sacrificial
    texts.
 [1100824]Enjoyments, pleasures, and delights, gladness, and rapturous
    ecstasies.
   Laughter and merriment and dance entered the body as a home.
 [1100825]Discourse and conversation, and the shrill-resounding cries of
    woe,
   All entered in, the motives and the purposes combined there-
    with.
 [1100826]Inbreath and outbreath, ear and eye, decay and freedom from
    decay.
   Breath upward and diffused, voice, mind, these quickly with the
    body move, [p. 67]
 [1100827]All earnest wishes, all commands, directions, and admonish-
    ments.
   Reflections, all deliberate plans entered the body as a home.
 [1100828]They laid in the abhorrent frame those waters hidden, bright,
    and thick,
   Which in the bowels spring from blood, from mourning or from
    hasty toil.
 [1100829]Fuel they turned to bone, and then they set light waters in the
    frame.
   The molten butter they made seed: then the Gods entered into
    man.
 [1100830]All Waters, all the Deities. Viraj with Brahma at her side:
   Brahma into the body passed: Prajapati is Lord thereof.
 [1100831]The Sun and Wind formed, separate, the eye and vital breath of
    man.
   His other person have the Gods bestowed on Agni as a gift.
 [1100832]Therefore whoever knoweth man regardeth him as Brahman's
    self:
   For all the Deities abide in him as cattle in their pen.
 [1100833]At his first death he goeth hence, asunder, in three separate
    parts.
   He goeth yonder with one part, with one he goeth yonder:
    here he sinketh downward with a third.
 [1100834]In the primeval waters cold the body is deposited.
   In this there is the power of growth: from this is power of
    growth declared.

HYMN IX

  

An incantation for the destruction of a hostile army

[1100901]All arms and every arrow, all the power and might that bows
    possess,
   The warlike weapon, axes, swords, the plan and purpose in the
    heart,
   All this, O Arbudi, make thou visible to our enemies, and let
    them look on mist and fog.
 [1100902]Arise ye and prepare yourselves: ye, the celestial hosts, are
    friends.
   Let your mysterious natures be seen by our friends O Arbudi.
 [1100903]Rise both of you: begin your work with fettering and binding.
    fast,
   Assail, both of you, Arbudi, the armies of our enemies.
 [1100904]The God whose name is Arbudi, and Nyarbudi the Mighty
   One,
   The two by whom the air and this great earth are compassed
    and possessed,
   With these two friends of Indra I go forth to conquer with the
    host.
 [1100905]Rise with our army stand thou up. O Godlike Being, Arbudi.
   Breaking the hosts of enemies, surround them with thy winding
    coils.
 [1100906]Exhibiting, O Arbudi, seven children of the mist and fog,
   When butter hath been offered, rise with all of these and with
    the host.
 [1100907]Beating her breast, with tearful face, let the short-earned, the
    wild-haired hag. [p. 69]
   Shriek loudly when a man is slain, pierced through by thee, O
   Arbudi;
 [1100908]Snatching away the vertebra, while with her thought she seeks
    her son,
   Her husband, brother, kin, when one, Arbudi! hath been pierc-
    ed by thee.
 [1100909]Let vultures, ravens, kites, and crows, and every carrion-eating
    bird.
   Feast on our foes, and show where one, Arbudi! hath been
    pierced by thee.
 [1100910]Then let each greedy beast of prey, and fly and worm regale
    itself
   Upon the human corpse where one, Arbudi, hath been pierced
    by thee.
 [1100911]Attack them, both of you; bear off their vital breath O Nyar-
    budi.
   Let mingled shouts and echoing cries of woe amid our foemen
    show where thou, O Arbudi, hast pierced
 [1100912]Shake them, and let them sink with fear: e'erwhelm our enemies
    with dread.
   With widely-grasping bends of arm, O Arbudi, crush down our
    foes.
 [1100913]Let those mens' arms grow faint and weak, dull be the purpose
    of their heart;
   And let not aught of them be left when thou, O Arbudi, hast
    pierced.
 [1100914]Self-smiting, beating breast and thigh, careless of unguent, with
    their hair dishevelled, weeping,
   hags shall run together, when a man is slain, when thou, O
   Arbudi, hast pierced.
 [1100915]Apsarases with dog-like mates, and Rupakas, O Arbudi,
   And her who licks the cup inside, and seeks to wound in ill-
    kept place,
   All these, O Arbudi, do thou make visible to our enemies and
    let them look on mists and fog.
 [1100916]The fiend who creeps upon the sword, maimed, dwelling where
   Lthe wounded lie,
   The misty shapes that lurk concealed, Gandharvas and Apsara-
    ses, demons, and snakes and Other Folk; [p. 70]
 [1100917]Armed with four fangs and yellow teeth, deformed, with faces
    smeared with blood, the terrible and fearless ones,
 [1100918]Make thou, O Arbudi, those wings of hostile armies quake with
    dread.
   Let Conqueror and Victor, friends of Indra, overcome our foes.
 [1100919]Stifled and crushed, O Nyarbudi, low let the smitten foeman lie.
   With tongue of fire and crest of smoke go conquering maidens
    with our host!
 [1100920]May Indra, Lord of Might, strike down each bravest warrior of
    the foes,
   Whom this our band hath put to flight: let not one man of
    those escape.
 [1100921]Let their hearts burst asunder, let their breath fly up and pass
    away.
   Let dryness of the mouth o'ertake our foemen, not the friendly
    ones.
 [1100922]The clever and the foolish ones, those who are twisted round,
    the deaf,
   The dusky-hued, the hornless goats and those whose voice is like
    the buck's,
   All these, O Arbudi, do thou make visible to our enemies:
    cause them to look on mists and fog.
 [1100923]Arbudi and Trishandhi fall upon our foes and scatter them,
   So that, O Indra, Lord of Might, Slayer of Vritra, we may kill
    thousands of these our enemies!
 [1100924]Tall trees, and those who live in woods, the herbs and creeping
    plants of Earth,
   Gandharvas, and Apsarases, Snakes, [       ] Beings, Fathers,
   Gods,
   All these do thou, O Arbudi, make visible to our enemies:
    cause them to look on mists and fog.
 [1100925]High sway have Maruts, and the God Aditya, Brahmanaspati,
   High sway have Indra, Agni, and Dilator, Mitra, Prajapati,
   High sway have Rishis given to you, showing upon our enemies
    where thou, O Arbudi, hast pierced.
 [1100926]With full dominion over these, rise, stand ye up, prepare your-
    selves,
   Ye are our friends, celestial hosts. When ye have won this
    battle, go, each to his several sphere, apart.

HYMN X

[1101001]Rise up, with all your banners rise; prepare your strength, ye
    vapoury Forms!
   Serpents and fiends and Other Folk, charge and pursue our
    enemies!
 [1101002]Let those who bear an evil name, in air, in heaven on earth, and
    men,
   After Trishandhi's will, revere your power, the sway that Know-
    ledge gives, together with your ruddy flags.
 [1101003]Let those with iron faces, with faces like needles or like combs,
   Flesh-eaters, rapid as the wind, cling closely to our foemen with
   Trishandhi for their thunderbolt.
 [1101004]Omniscient Aditya, make full many a corpse to disappear.
   Let this devoted army of Trishandhi be in my control.
 [1101005]Rise up, O Godlike Being, rise, Arbudi, with thine army: this,
   Tribute is sacrificed to thee, Trishandhi's welcome offering
 [1101006]May this four-footed White-foot, may this arrow brace and bind
    thee fast:
   Together with Trishandhi's host, be thou, O Witchcraft, meant
    for foes.
 [1101007]Down let the dim-eyed demon fly, and let her shorteared sister
    shriek:
   Red be the banners when the host of Arbudi hath won the day.
 [1101008]Let all the birds that move on wings come downward, all fowls
    that roam the heavens and air's midregion. [p. 72]
   Let beasts of prey and flies attacks, and vultures that eat raw
    flesh mangle and gnaw the carcase.
 [1101009]By that same binding treaty which thou madest, Brihaspati!
    with Indra! and with Brahma,
   By Indra's pledge I bid the Gods come hither. Conquer on this
    side, not on their side yonder.
 [1101010]Brihaspati Angirasa, Rishis made strong and keen by prayer,
   Have set Trishandhi in the heaven, dire weapon that destroys
    the fiends.
 [1101011]The Gods enjoyed Trishandhi for the sake of energy and power,
   Him under whose protection, both, Indra and yon Aditya stand.
 [1101012]The Gods, victorious, won themselves all worlds by this oblation,
    which
   Brihaspati Angirasa effused, a very thunderbolt, a weapon to
    destory the friends.
 [1101013]That fiend-destroying weapon which Brihaspati Angirasa poured
    out and made a thunderbolt.
   Even therewith, Brihaspati, I brush that hostile armament, and
    strike the foemen down with might.
 [1101014]Over to us come all the Gods who eat the hallowed sacrifice
   With this oblation be ye pleased: conquer on this side, not on
    that.
 [1101015]Over,to us let all Gods come: dear is Trishandhi's offering.
   Keen the great pledge through which, of old, the Asuras were
    overthrown.
 [1101016]Let Vayu bend the arrow-points of those who are our enemies.
   Let Indra break their arms away: no power to lay the shaft be
    theirs!
   Aditya utterly destroy their missile! Chandramas bar the path
    of him who lingers!
 [1101017]If they have issued forth strongholds of Gods, and made their
    shields of prayer,
   Gaining protection for their lives, protection round about, make
    all their instigation powerless
 [1101018]With the Flesh-eater and with Death, following the Purohita,
   On! forward with Trishandhi's host! conquering enemies
    advance!
 [1101019]Do thou, Trishandhi, with the gloom of darkness compass round
    our foes; [p. 73]
   Let none escape of them expelled with speckled butter mixt with
    curds.
 [1101020]Let White-foot fall upon those wings of our opponents' arma-
    ment;
   Mazed and bewildered be those hands of foes this day, O Nyar-
    budi.
 [1101021]Mazed are the foemen, Nyarbudi! Slay thou each bravest man
    of them: with this our army slaughter them.
 [1101022]Low lie the warrior, mailed, unmailed, each foeman in the rush
    of war.
   Down-smitten with the strings of bows, the fastenings of mail,
    the charge!
 [1101023]The armour-clad, the armourless, enemies clothed with coats of
    mail,
   All these struck down, O Arbudi, let dogs devour upon the
    earth.
 [1101024]Car-borne and carless fighting men, riders and those who go
    on foot,
   All these, struck down, let vultures, kites, and all, the birds of
    air devour.
 [1101025]Low let the hostile army lie, thousands of corpses, on the
    ground,
   Pierced through and rent to pieces where the deadly weapons
    clash in fight.
 [1101026]With eagles let them eat the evil-hearted, pierced in the vitals,
    lying crushed and howling.
   The foe whoe'er will fight against this our protecting sacrifice.
 [1101027]With this which Gods attend, with this which never fails to gain
    its end,
   Let Indra, Vritra-slayer, smite, and with Trishandhi as a bolt.

BOOK XII

  

HYMN I

  

A hymn of prayer and praise to Prithivi or deified Earth

[1200101]Truth, high and potent Law, the Consecrating Rite, Fervour,
   Brahma, and Sacrifice uphold the Earth.
   May she, the Queen of all that is and is to be, may Prithivi
    make ample space and room for us.
 [1200102]Not over awded by the crowd of Manu's sons, she who hath
    many heights and floods and level plains;
   She who bears plants endowed with many varied powers, may
   Prithivi for us spread wide and favour us.
 [1200103]In whom the sea, and Sindhu, and the waters, in whom our food
    and corn-lands had their being,
   In whom this all that breathes and moves is active, this Earth.
    assign us foremost rank and station!
 [1200104]She who is Lady of the earth's four regions, in whom our food
    and corn-lands had their being,
   Nurse in each place of breathing, moving creatures, this Earth.
    vouchsafe us kine with milk that fails not!
 [1200105]On whom the men of old before us battled, on whom the Gods
    attacked the hostile demons,
   The varied home of bird, and kine and horses, this Prithivi
    vouchsafe us luck and splendour!
 [1200106]Firm standing-place, all-bearing, store of treasures, gold-breasted,
    harbourer of all that moveth.
   May Earth who bears Agni Vaisvanara, Consort of mighty
    Indra, give us great possessions
 [1200107]May Earth, may Prithivi, always protected with ceaseless care by
    Gods who never slumber,
   May she pour out for us delicious nectar, may she bedew us
    with a flood of splendour.
 [1200108]She who at first was water in the ocean, whom with their wond-
    rous powers the sages followed,
   May she whose heart is in the highest heaven, compassed about
    wit h truth, and everlasting, [p. 76]
   May she, this Earth, bestow upon us lustre, and grant us power
    in loftiest dominion.
 [1200109]On whom the running universal waters flow day and night with
    never-ceasing motion,
   May she with many streams pour milk to feed us, may she
    bedew us with a flood of splendour.
 [1200110]She whom the Asvins measured out, o'er whom the foot of
   Vishnu strode,
   Whom Indra, Lord of Power and Might, freed from all foemen
    for himself,
   May Earth pour out her milk for us, a mother unto me her son.
 [1200111]O Prithivi, auspicious be thy woodlands, auspicious be thy hills
    and snow-clad mountains.
   Unslain, unwounded, unsubdued, I have set foot upon the
   Earth,
   On earth brown, black, ruddy and every-coloured, on the firm
    earth that Indra guards from danger.
 [1200112]O Prithivi, thy centre and thy navel, all forces that have issued
    from thy body
   Set us amid those forces; breathe upon us. I am the son of
   Earth, Earth is my Mother. Parjanya is my Sire; may he
    promote me.
 [1200143]Earth on whose surface they enclose the altar, and all-performers
    spin the thread of worship;
   In whom the stakes of sacrifice, resplendent, are fixed and raised
    on high before the oblation, may she, this Earth, prospering,
    make us prosper.
 [1200114]The man who hates us, Earth! who fights against us, who
    threaten us with thought or deadly weapon, make him our
    thrall as thou hast done aforetime.
 [1200115]Produced from thee, on thee move mortal creatures: thou
    bearest them, both quadruped and biped.
   Thine, Prithivi, are these Five human Races, for whom, though
    mortal, Surya as he rises spreads with his rays the light that is
    immortal.
 [1200116]In concert may these creatures yield us blessings. With honey of
    discourse, O Earth, endow me.
 [1200117]Kind, ever gracious be the Earth we tread on, the firm Earth,
   Prithivi, borne up by Order, mother of plants and herbs, the
    all-producer. [p. 77]
 [1200118]A vast abode hast thou become, the Mighty. Great stress is on
    thee, press and agitation, but with unceasing care great Indra
    guards thee.
   So make us shine, O Earth, us with the splendour of gold. Let
    no man look on us with hatred.
 [1200119]Agni is in the earth, in plants; the waters hold Agni in them,
    in the stones is Agni.
   Agni abideth deep in men: Agnis abide in cows and steeds.
 [1200120]Agni gives shine and heat in heaven: the spacious air is his, the
   God's
   Lover of fatness, bearer of oblation, men enkindle him.
 [1200121]Dark-kneed, invested with a fiery mantle, Prithivi sharpen me
    and give me splendour!
 [1200122]On earth they offer sacrifice and dressed oblation to the Gods.
   Men, mortals, live upon the earth by food in their accustomed
    way.
   May that Earth grant us breath and vital power. Prithivi give
    me life of long duration!
 [1200123]Scent that hath risen from thee, O Earth, the fragrance which.
    growing herbs and plants and waters carry,
   Shared by Apsarases, shared by Gandharvas therewith make
    thou me sweet: let no man hate me.
 [1200124]Thy scent which entered and possessed the lotus, the scent
    which they prepared at Surya's bridal,
   Scent which Immortals Earth! of old collected, therewith make
    thou me sweet: let no man hate me.
 [1200125]Thy scent in women and in men, the luck and light that is in.
    males,
   That is in heroes and in steeds in sylvan beasts and elephants,
   The splendid energy of maids, therewith do thou unite us,.
   Earth! Let no man look on us with hate.
 [1200126]Rock earth, and stone, and dust, this Earth is held together,.
    firmly bound.
   To this gold-breasted Prithivi mine adoration have I paid.
 [1200127]Hither we call the firmly held, the all-supporting Prithivi,
   On whom the trees, lords of the wood, stand evermore immov-
    able.
 [1200128]Sitting at ease or rising up, standing or going on our way.
   With our right foot and with our left we will not reel upon the
    earth. [p. 78]
 [1200129]I speak to Prithivi the purifier, to patient Earth who groweth
    strong through Brahma.
   O Earth, may we recline on thee who bearest strength, increase,
    portioned share of food, and fatness.
 [1200130]Purified for our bodies flow the waters: we bring distress on
    him who would attack us.
   I cleanse myself, O Earth, with that which cleanseth.
 [1200131]Earth, be thine eastern and thy northern regions, those lying
    southward and those lying westward.
   Propitious unto me in all my movements. Long as I tread the
    ground let me not stumble.
 [1200132]Drive us not from the west or east, drive us not from the north
    or south,
   Be gracious unto us, O Earth: let not the robbers find us; keep
    the deadly weapon far away.
 [1200133]Long as, on thee, I look around, possessing Surya as a friend,
   So long, through each succeeding year, let not my power of
    vision fail.
 [1200134]When, as I lie, O Earth, I turn upon my right side and my left,
   When stretched at all our length we lay our ribs on thee who
    meetest us.
   Do us no injury there, O Earth who furnishest a bed for all.
 [1200135]Let what I dig from thee, O Earth, rapidly spring and grow
    again.
   O Purifier, let me not pierce through thy vitals or thy heart.
 [1200136]Earth, may thy summer, and thy rains, and autumn, thy winter,
    and thy dewy frosts, and spring-time.
   May thy years, Prithivi! and ordered seasons, and day and
    night pour out for us abundance.
 [1200137]The purifier, shrinking from the Serpent, she who held fires that
    lie within the waters,
   Who gives as prey the God-blaspheming Dasyus, Earth choosing
   Indra for her Lord, not Vritra, hath clung to Sakra, to the
   Strong and Mighty.
 [1200138]Base of the seat and sheds, on whom the sacrificial stake is
    reared,
   On whom the Yajus-knowing priests recite their hymns and
    chant their psalms,
   And ministers are busied that Indra may drink the Soma juice; [p. 79]
 [1200139]On whom the ancient Rishis, they who made the world, sang
    forth the cows,
   Seven worshippers, by session, with their fervent zeal and
    sacrifice;
 [1200140]May she, the Earth, assign to us the opulence for which we
    yearn,
   May Bhaga share and aid the task and Indra come to lead the
    way.
 [1200141]May she, the Earth, whereon men sing and dance with varied
    shout and noise,
   Whereon men meet in battle, and the war-cry and the drum
    resound,
   May she drive off our foemen, may Prithivi rid me of my foes.
 [1200142]On whom is food, barley and rice, to whom these Races Five
    belong,
   Homage to her, P arjanya's wife, to her whose marrow is the
    rain!
 [1200143]Whose castles are the work of Gods, and men wage war upon
    her plain
   The Lord of Life make Prithivi, who beareth all things in her
    womb, pleasant to us on every side!
 [1200144]May Earth the Goddess, she who bears her treasure stored up
    in many a place, gold, gems, and riches,
   Giver of opulence, grant great possessions to us bestowing them
    with love and favour.
 [1200145]Earth, bearing folk of many a varied language with divers rites
    as suits their dwelling-places,
   Pour, like a constant cow that never faileth, a thousand streams
    of treasure to enrich me!
 [1200146]Thy snake, thy sharply stinging scorpion, lying concealed, be-
    wildered, chilled with cold of winter,
   The worm, O Prithivi, each thing that in the Rains revives and
    stirs,
   Creeping, forbear to creep on us! With all things gracious bless
    thou us.
 [1200147]Thy many ways on which the people travel, the road for car and
    wain to journey over,
   Thereon meet both the good and bad, that pathway may we
    attain without a foe or robber. With all things gracious bless
    thou us. [p. 80]
 [1200148]Supporting both the foolish and the weighty she bears the death
    both of the good and evil.
   In friendly concord with the boar, Earth opens herself for the
    wild swine that roams the forest.
 [1200149]All sylvan beasts of thine that love the woodlands, man-eaters,.
    forest-haunting, lions, tigers,
   Hyena, wolf, Misfortune, evil spirit, drive from us, chase the
    demons to a distance.
 [1200150]Gandharvas and Apsarases, Kimidins, and malignant sprites,
   Pisachas all, and Rakshasas, these keep thou, Earth! afar from
    us.
 [1200151]To whom the winged bipeds fly together, birds of each various
    kind, the swans, the eagles;
   On whom the Wind comes rushing, Matarisvan, rousing the
    dust and causing trees to tremble, and flame pursues the blast.
    hither and thither;
 [1200152]Earth, upon whom are settled, joined together, the night and
    day, the dusky and the ruddy, Prithivi compassed by the rain
    about her,
   Happily may she stablish us in each delightful dwelling place.
 [1200153]Heaven, Earth, the realm of Middle Air have granted me this
    ample room,
   Agni, Sun, Waters, all the Gods have joined to give me mental
    power.
 [1200154]I am victorious, I am called the lord superior on earth,
   Triumphant, all-o'erpowering the conqueror on every side
 [1200155]There, when the Gods, O Goddess, named thee, spreading thy
    wide expanse as thou wast broadening eastward,
   Then into thee passed many a charm and glory: thou madest
    for thyself the world's four regions.
 [1200156]In hamlets and in woodland, and in all assemblages on earth,
   In gatherings, meeting of the folk, we will speak glorious things
    of thee.
 [1200157]As the horse scattereth the dust, the people who dwelt upon
    the land, at birth, she scattered,
   Leader and head of all the world, delightful, the trees' protectress
    and the plants' upholder.
 [1200158]Whate'er I say I speak with honey-sweetness, whatever I behold
    for that they love me.
   Dazzling, impetuous am I: others who fiercely stir I slay. [p. 81]
 [1200159]Mild, gracious, sweetly odorous, milky, with nectar in her breast,
   May Earth, may Prithivi bestow her benison, with milk, on me.
 [1200160]Whom Visvakarman with oblation followed, when she was set
    in mid-air's billowy ocean
   A useful vessel, hid, when, for enjoyment, she was made mani-
    fest to those with mothers.
 [1200161]Thou art the vessel that containeth people, Aditi, granter of the
    wish, far-spreading.
   Prajapati, the first-born Son of Order, supplieth thee with what-
    soe'er thou lackest.
 [1200162]Let thy breasts, frec from sickness and Consumption, be.
   Prithivi, produced for our advantage.
   Through long-extended life wakeful and watching still may we
    be thy tributary servants.
 [1200163]O Earth, my Mother, set thou me happily in a place secure.
   Of one accord with Heaven, O Sage, set me in glory and in
    wealth.

HYMN II

  

A funeral hymn, and deprecation of Agni the Consumer of corpses

[1200201]This is no place to hold thee; mount the Nada: this lead is
    thine appointed share. Come hither.
   Together with Consumption in the cattle, Consumption in our
    men, go henee, go southward.
 [1200202]With this we chase and banish all consumptive malady and
   Death,
   With sinner andamalicious man, with helper and with minister,
 [1200203]Death and Misfortune we expel, Malignity we drive away.
   O Agni, thou who eatest not the corpse, eat him who hateth us:
    him whom we hate we send to thee. [p. 83]
 [1200204]If the corpse-eating Agni, or a tiger leaving his lair, hath entered
    this our homestead,
   With beans prepared in butter I expel him: far let him go to
    fires that lie in waters.
 [1200205]When, angered that a man hath died, we in our wrath have
    banished thee,
   That deed is easily set right through thee: we kindle thee again.
 [1200206]Again have the Adityas, Rudras, Vasus, the Brahman, bringer
    of good things, O Agni,
   Again hath Brahmanaspati disposed thee for long life lasting
    through a hundred autumns.
 [1200207]I sweep afar, for sacrifice to Fathers, corpse-eating Agni who
    hath come among us,
   Although he saw this other, Jatavedas: in loftiest space let him
    inflame the caldron.
 [1200208]I drive corpse-eating Agni to a distance: sin-laden let him go to
   Yamas vassals.
   Here let this other, Jatavedas, carry oblation to the Deities, fore-
    knowing.
 [1200209]I quickly sweep away corpse-eating Agni, Death, with his bolt
    potdepriving men of motion.
   From household fire, well-knowing, I divide him: so in the
    world of Fathers be his portion.
 [1200210]Corpse-eating Agni, toil-worn, meet for praises, I send away
    bypaths used by the Fathers.
   Stay there; keep watch among the Fathers: come not again to
    us by ways whereon Gods travel.
 [1200211]They being cleansed and bright, the purifiers, kindle Sankasuka
    for our well-being.
   Impurity leaveth us and sin departeth: lighted by the good
    cleanser Agni cleanseth.
 [1200212]Agni the God, the Breaker-up, hath mounted to the heights of
    heaven.
   Released from all transgression, he hath from the curse delivered
    us.
 [1200213]On Agni here, the Breaker-up, we wipe impurities away.
   Cleansed, fit for sacrifice have we become: may he prolong our
    lives.
 [1200214]The Breaker-up, the Burster, the Destroyer, and the Silent One, [p. 84]
   These have expelled Consumption far, far off from thee and all
    thou hast,
 [1200215]Corpse-eating Agni we expel, the Agni who bewilders men,
   Him who is in our horses, in our heroes, cows, and goats, and
    sheep:
 [1200216]We drive thee forth to other folk, to alien cattle, alien steeds,
   Thee the corpse-eating Agni, thee the Agni who bewilders men,
 [1200217]Whereon the Deities, whereon men too have purified themselves,
   Exalting fatness, cleanse thyself, Agni, therein and mount to
    heaven.
 [1200218]O Agni, kindled and adored, turn not away to visit us.
   Shine brightly even there in heaven, so that we long may see the
   Sun.
 [1200219]Wipe all away on lead and reed, on Agni, him who breaketh up,
   Then on a black-hued sheep, and on a cushion pain that racks.
    the head,
 [1200220]Wipe off pollution, lay it in the lead and in the black-hued
    sheep,
   And headache in the cushion; then be cleansed and fit to sacri-
    fice.
 [1200221]Go onward, Death, pursue thy special pathway apart from that
    which Gods are wont to travel.
   To thee I say it who hast eyes and hearest: great grow the
    number of these men around us!
 [1200222]Divided from the dead are these, the living: now is our calling
    on the Gods successful.
   We have gone forth for dancing and for laughter: may we with
    brave sons speak to the assembly.
 [1200223]Here I erect this rampart for the living: let none of these, none
    other, reach this limit.
   May they survive a hundred lengthened autumns, and may they
    bury Death beneath this mountain.
 [1200224]Live your full lives and find age delightful, all of you striving,
    one behind the other.
   May Tvashtar, maker of fair things, be gracious, and lead your
    whole lives on to full existence.
 [1200225]As the days follow days in close succession, as with the seasons
    duly come the seasons.
   As each successor fails not his foregoer, so constitute the lives of
    these, Ordainer! [p. 85]
 [1200226]Gather your strength, my friends; the stream flows stony:
    acquit yourselves as men, and cross the river.
   Abandon here the powers that were malignant, and let us cross
    to powers exempt from sickness.
 [1200227]Rise up erect, cross over, my companions: the stream is stony
    that flows here before us.
   Abandon here the powers that were ungracious, and let us cross
    to powers benign and friendly.
 [1200228]Becoming pure and bright and purifying begin the Vaisvadevi
    strain for splendour..
   May we rejoice, o'erpassing troublous places, with all our heroes
    through a hundred winters.
 [1200229]On pathways swept by wind, directed upward, passing beyond
    the lower, on the higher,
   Thrice seven times have the Rishis, the Departed, forced Mrityu
    backward with the fastened fetter.
 [1200230]Effecting Mrityu's footstep ye came hither, to further times pro-
    longing your existence,
   Seated, drive Mrityu to his proper dwelling: then may we,
    living, speak to the assembly.
 [1200231]Let these unwidowed dames with goodly husbands adorn them-
    selves with fragrant balm and unguent,
   Decked with fair jewels, tearless, sound and healthy, first let the
    dames go up to where he lieth.
 [1200232]I with oblation separate both classes, and with my prayer dis-
    part their several portions.
   I offer food that wastes not to the Fathers, a nd to these men
    give life of long duration.
 [1200233]That Agni, Fathers! who, himself immortal, hath entered and
    possessed our mortal bosoms,
   Even him I grasp and hold the God with me, Let him not hate
    us, may we never hate him.
 [1200234]When ye have left the household fire, with the Corpse-eater
    southward go.
   Do that which is delightful to the Fathers, Brahmans, and your-
    selves.
 [1200235]Agni, the banqueter on flesh, not banished, for the eldest son
   Taketh a double share of wealth and spoileth it with poverty.
 [1200236]What man acquires by plough, by war, all that he wins by toil
    of hand, [p. 86]
   He loses all if Agni the Carnivorous be not set aside,
 [1200237]Unholy, splendour-reft is he, his sacrifice unfit to eat. Krayad
    deprives of tilth of cow, of riches him whom he pursues,
 [1200238]Oft as a greedy beggar speaks the mortal who has brought
    distress,
   Those whom Carnivorous Agni close at hand runs after and
    detects.
 [1200239]When a dame's husband dies the house is tangled  in
   Grahi's net.
   A learned Brahman must be sought to drive Carnivorous Agni,
    forth.
 [1200240]From any evil we have done, act of impurity or sin,
   Let waters purge me and from all that comes from Agni
   Breaker-up.
 [1200241]By pathways travelled by the Gods these waters, well-knowing,
    from below have mounted upward.
   High on the summit of the raining mountain the ancient rivers
    fresh and new are flowing.
 [1200242]Drive off Carnivorous Agni, thou Agni who eatest not the flesh;.
    carry oblation paid to Gods.
 [1200243]The Flesh-eater hath entered him: he hath pursued the Flesh-
    eater.
   Making two tigers different-wise, I bear away the ungracious
    one.
 [1200244]He who holds Gods within himself, the rampart and defence of
    men,
   Agni, the sacred household fire, hath come and stands between
    them both.
 [1200245]Prolong the lives of those who live, O Agni, Let the dead go
    unto world of Fathers.
   As goodly household fire burn up Arati; give this man dawn
    brighter than all the mornings.
 [1200246]Subduing all our adversaries, Agni, give us their food, their
    strength and their possessions.
 [1200247]Grasp ye this Indra, furtherer, satisfier: he will release you
    from disgrace and trouble.
   With him drive back the shaft that flies against you, with him.
    ward off the missile shot by Rudra.
 [1200248]Seize with firm hold the Ox who boundeth forward: he will
    uplift you from disgrace and trouble. [p. 87]
   Enter this ship of Savitar; let us flee from poverty over all the
    six expenses.
 [1200249]Thou followest the day and night, supporting, standing, at
    peace, promoting, rich in heroes.
   Long bearing undiseased and happy sleepers, be ours, O Bed,
    with smell of man about thee,
 [1200250]They sever from the Gods, they live in sin and misery evermore,
   Those whom from very near at hand Carnivorous Agni casteth
    down as a horse tramples down the reeds.
 [1200251]The faithless, who from lust of wealth abide with him who feeds
    on flesh,
   For ever set upon the fire an alien caldron, not their own.
 [1200252]Forward in spirit would he fly, and often turns he back again,
   Whomso Carnivorous Agni from anear discovers and torments.
 [1200253]Among tame beasts the black ewe is thy portion, and the bright
    lead is thine, they say, Flesh-eater!
   Mashed beans have been assigned thee for oblation go seek the
    dark wood and the wildernesses.
 [1200254]I sought the rustling sugar-cane, white Seasamum, and cane and
    reed.
   I made this Indra's fuel, and the Fire of Yama I removed.
 [1200255]Against the sinking western Sun I set them; each sundered path,
    knowing my way, I entered.
   I have warned off the ghosts of the Departed: to these I give
    the boon of long existence.

HYMN III

  

An accompaniment to the preparation and presentation of sacrificial offerings by a householder and his wife, with prayer for prosperity and happiness on earth and in heaven

[1200301]Mount, male from male, the skin. Go thither: summon those
    whom thou lovest, one and all, to meet thee,
   Strong as ye were when first ye met each other, still be your
    strength the same in Yama's kingdom.
 [1200302]So strong your sight, so many be your powers, so great your
    force, your energies so many,
   When fire attends the body as its fuel, then may, ye gain full
    chargers, O ye couple.
 [1200303]Together in this world, in God-ward pathway, together be ye in
    the realms of Yama.
   Invite, made pure with means of purifying, whatever seed of
    yours hath been developed.
 [1200304]Do ye, O sons, unite you with the waters, meeting this living
    man, ye life-sustainers,
   Allot to them the Odana your mother is making ready, which
    they call immortal.
 [1200305]That which your mother and your sire, to banish sin and un-
    cleanness from their lips, are cooking.
   That Odana with hundred streams, sky-reaching, hath in its
    might prevaded earth and heaven.
 [1200306]Live with your sons, when life on earth is ended, live in the
    sphere most rich in light and sweetness.
   In skies that have been won by sacrificers make both the worlds,
    earth, heaven, your habitation.
 [1200307]Approach the eastern, yea: the eastern region, this is the
    sphere to which the faithful turn them,
   Your cooked oblation that in fire was offered, together, wife and
    husband, meet to guard it. [p. 90]
 [1200308]Now, as your steps approach the southern quarter, move in.
    your circling course about this vessel.
   Herein, accordant with the Fathers, Yama shall mightily protect
    your cooked oblation.
 [1200309]Best of the regions is indeed this western wherein the King and
    gracious Lord is Soma.
   Thither resort for rest, follow the pious. Then gain the laden
    chargers, O ye couple.
 [1200310]Ever victorious is the northern region: may the east quarter set
    us first and foremost.
   The Man became the five-divisioned metre. May we abide wit .
    all our members perfect.
 [1200311]This stedfast realm is Queen. To her be homage! To me and
    to my sons may she be gracious.
   Guard thou, O Goddess Aditi, all-bounteous, our cooked oblation
    as an active warder.
 [1200312]Embrace us as a father clasps his children. Here on the Earth
    let kindly breezes fan us.
   Let the rice-mess these two cook here, O Goddess, know this
    our truthfulness and zealous fervour.
 [1200313]If the dark bird hath come to us and, stealing the hanging. .
    morsel, settled in his dwelling,
   Or if the slave-girl hath, wet-handed, smearing the pestle and
    the mortar, cleansed the waters,
 [1200314]This pressing-stone, broad-based and strength-bestowing, made
    pure by cleansing means, shall chase the demon.
   Mount on the skin: afford us great protection, Let not the sons'
    sin fall on wife and husband.
 [1200315]Together with the Gods, banning Pis5chas and demons, hath
   Vanaspati come hither.
   He shall rise up and send his voice out loudly. May we win all
    the worlds with him to help us.
 [1200316]Seven victims held the sacrificial essence, the bright one and the
    one that hath grown feeble.
   The three-and-thirty Deities attend them. As such, conduct us
    io the world of Svarga.
 [1200317]Unto the world of Svarga shalt thou lead us: there may we dwell
    beside our wife and children.
   I take thy hand Let not Destruction, let not Malignity come
    hither and subdue us. [p. 91]
 [1200318]We have subdued that sinful-hearted Grahi. Thou shalt speak
    sweetly having chased the darkness.
   Let not the wooden gear made ready fail us, nor harm the grain
    of rice that pays due worship.
 [1200319]Soon to be, decked with butter, all-embracing, come to this
    world wherewith birth unites thee.
   Seize thou the winnowing-fan which rains have nourished, and
    let this separate the chaff and refuse.
 [1200320]Three worlds hath Power Divine marked out and measured,
   Fheaven yonder, and the earth, and airs mid-region.
   Grasp ye the stalks and in your hands retain them: let them be
    watered and again be winnowed.
 [1200321]Manifold, various are the shapes of victims. Thou growest uni-
    form by great abundance.
   Push thou away this skin of ruddy colour: the stone will cleanse
    as one who cleanses raiment.
 [1200322]Earth upon earth l set thee. This thy body is con-substantial,.
    but in form it differs.
   Whate'er hath been worn off or scratched in fixing, leak not
    thereat: I spread a charm to mend it.
 [1200323]Thou for thy son shalt yearn as yearns a mother. I lay thee
    down and with the earth unite thee.
   Conjoined with sacrificial gear and butter may pot and jar stand
    firmly on the altar.
 [1200324]Eastward may Agni as he cooks preserve thee. Southward may
   Indra, grit by Maruts, guard thee,
   Varuna strengthen and support thee westward, and Soma on
    the north hold thee together.
 [1200325]Drops flow, made pure by filters, from the rain-cloud: to heaven
    and earth and to the worlds they travel,
   May Indra light them up, poured in the vessel, lively and sted-
    fast, quickening living creatures.
 [1200326]From heaven they come, they visit earth, and rising from earth
    unite themselves with air's mid-region,
   Purified, excellent, they with shine in beauty. Thus may they lead us
    to the world of Svarga.
 [1200327]Yea, and supreme, alike in conformation, and brilliant and
    refulgent and immortal,
   As such, enjoined, well-guarding, water-givers, dress ye the
   Odana for wife and husband. [p. 92]
 [1200328]Numbered, they visit earth, these drops of moisture, commensu-
    rate with plants and vital breathings,
   Unnumbered, scattered, beautiful in colour, the bright, ones
    have pervaded all refulgence.
 [1200329]Heated, they rage and boil in agitation, they cast about their
    foam and countless bubbles
   Like a fond woman when she sees her husband--what time ye
    waters and these rice-grains mingle,
 [1200330]Take up these rice-grains lying at the bottom: led them be blent
    and mingled with the waters.
   This water I have measured in the vessel, if as mid-points the
    rice-grains have been meted.
 [1200331]Present the sickle: quickly bring it hither. Let them out plants
    and joints with hands that harm not.
   So may the plants be free from wrath against us, they o'er
    whose realm Soma hath won dominion.
 [1200332]Strew ye fresh grass for the boiled rice to rest on: fair let it be,
    sweet to the eye and spirit.
   Hither come Goddesses with Gods, and sitting here taste in
    proper season this oblation.
 [1200333]On the strewn grass. Vanaspati, be seated; commensurate with
   Gods and Agnishtomas.
   Let thy fair form, wrought as by Tvashtar's hatchet, mark these
    that yearn for thee within the vessel.
 [1200334]In sixty autumns may the Treasure-Guardian seek to gain
    heavenly light by cooked oblation.
   On this may sons and fathers live dependent. Send thou this
    mess to Fire that leads to heaven.
 [1200335]On the earth's breast stand firmly as supporter: may Deities
    stir thee who ne'er hast shaken.
   So living man and wife with living children remove thee from
    the hearth of circling Agni.
 [1200336]All wishes that have blessed those with fulfilment, having won
    all the worlds have met together.
   Let them plunge in both stirring-spoon and ladle: raise this and
    set it in a single vessel.
 [1200337]Pour out the covering butter, spread it eastward: sprinkle this
    vessel over with the fatness.
   Greet this, ye Deities, with gentle murmur, as lowing cows wel-
    come their tender suckling. [p. 93]
 [1200338]Thou hast poured oil and made the worlds: let heaven, unequal-
    led, be spread out in wide extension.
   Herein be cooked the buffalo, strong-pinioned: the Gods shall
    give the Deities this oblation.
 [1200339]Whate'er thy wife, away from thee, makes ready, or what, O
    wife, apart from thee, thy husband,
   Combine it all: let it be yours in common while ye produce one
    world with joint endeavour.
 [1200340]All these now dwelling on the earth, mine offspring, these whom,
    this woman here, my wife, hath borne me,
   Invite them all unto the vessel: knowing their kinship have the
    children met together.
 [1200341]Swollen with savoury meath, the stream of treasures, sources of
    immortality blent with fatness
   Soma retains all these; in sixty autumns the Guardian Lord of
   Treasures may desire them.
 [1200342]The Lord of Treasures may desire this treasure: lordless on.
    every side be all the others.
   Our mess, presented seeking heaven, hath mounted in three
    divisions all three realms of Svarga.
 [1200343]May Agni burn the God-denying demon: let no carnivorous.
   Pis icha drink here.
   We drive him off, we keep him at a distance. Adityas and
   Angirases pursue him!
 [1200344]This meath do I announce, mingled with butter, to the Angi-
    rases and the Adityas.
   With pure hands ne'er laid roughly on a Brahman go, pious.
    couple, to the world of Svarga.
 [1200345]Of this have I obtained the noblest portion from that same
    world whence Parmeshthin gained it.
   Pour forth, besprinkle butter rich in fatness: the share of
   Angiras is here before us.
 [1200346]To Deities, to Truth, to holy Fervour this treasure we consign,.
    this rich deposit,
   At play, in meeting led it not desert us, never give out to anyone
    besides me.
 [1200347]I cook the offering, I present oblation: only my wife attends
    the holy service.
   A youthful world, a son hath been begotten. Begin a life that
    brings success and triumph. [p. 94]
 [1200348]There is no fault in this, no reservation, none when it goes with
    friends in close alliance.
   We have laid down this vessel in perfection: the cooked mess
    shall re-enter him who cooked it.
 [1200349]To those we love may we do acts that please them. Away to
    darkness go all those who hate us!
   Cow, ox, and strength of every kind approach us! Thus let
    them banish death of human beings.
 [1200350]Perfectly do the Agnis know each other, one visitor of plants
    and one of rivers,
   And all the Gods who shine and glow in heaven. Gold is the
    light of him who cooks oblation.
 [1200351]Man hath received this skin of his from nature: of other
    animals not one is naked.
   Ye make him clothe himself with might for raiment. Odana's
    mouth is a home-woven vesture.
 [1200352]Whatever thou may say at dice, in meeting, whatever falsehood
    through desire of riches,
   Ye two, about one common warp uniting, deposit all impurity
    within it.
 [1200353]Win thou the rain: approach the Gods. Around thee thou from
    the skin shalt make the smoke rise upward.
   Soon to be, decked with butter, all-embracing, come to this
    world wherewith one birth unites thee.
 [1200354]In many a shape hath heaven transformed its body, as in itself
    is known, of varied eolour.
   Cleansing the bright, the dark form hath it banished: the red
    form in the fire to thee I offer.
 [1200355]To the eastern region, to Agni the Regent, to Asita the Protector,
   Aditya the Archer, we present thee, this offering of ours. Do
    ye preserve it from aggression
   To full old age may Destiny conduct us; may full old age deliver
    us to Mrityu. Then may we be with our prepared oblation.
 [1200356]To the southern region, to Indra the Regent, to Tiraschiraji the
   Protector, to Yama the Archer, we present, etc. (as in stanza
    55)
 [1200357]To the western region, to Varuna the Regent, to Pridaku the
   Protector, to Food the Archer, we present, etc.
 [1200358]To the northern region, to Soma the Regent, to Svaja the Protec-
    tor, to Thunderbolt the Archer, we present, etc. [p. 95]
 [1200359]To the stedfast region, to Vishnu the Regent, to Kalmashagriva
    the Protector, to Plants the Archers, we present, etc.
 [1200360]To the upper region, to Brihaspati the Regent, to Svitra the
   Protector, to Rain the Archer, we present thee, this offering
    of ours. Do ye preserve it from aggression.
   To full old age may Destiny conduct us, may full old age deliver
    us to Mrityu. Then may we be with our prepared oblation.

HYMN IV

  

On the duty of giving cows to Brahmans, and the sin and danger of withholding the gift

[1200401]Give the gift, shall be his word: and straightway they have bound
    the Cow
   For Brahman priests who beg the boon. That bringeth sons and
    progeny.
 [1200402]He trades and traffics with his sons, and in his cattle suffers loss.
   Who will not give the Cow of Gods to Rishis children when
    they beg.
 [1200403]They perish through a hornless cow, a lame cow sinks them in a
    pit.
   Through a maimed cow his house is burnt: a one-eyed cow
    destroys his wealth.
 [1200404]Fierce fever where her droppings fall attacks the master of the
    kine.
   So have they named her Vasa, for thou art called uncontrollable.
 [1200405]The malady Viklindu springs on him from ground whereon she
    stands,
   And suddenly, from fell disease, perish the men on whom she
    sniffs.
 [1200406]Whoever twitches up her ears is separated from the Gods.
   He deems he makes a mark, but he diminishes his wealth
    thereby.
 [1200407]If to his own advantage one applies the long hair of her tail, [p. 98]
   His colts, in consequence thereof. die, and the wolf destroys his
    calves.
 [1200408]If, while her master owneth her, a carrion crow hath harmed her
    hair,
   His young boys die thereof, Decline o'ertakes them after fell
    disease.
 [1200409]What time the Dasi woman throws lye on the droppings of the
   Cow,
   Misshapen birth arises thence, inseparable from that sin.
 [1200410]For Gods and Brahmans is the Cow produced when first she
    springs to life,
   Hence to the priests must she be given: this they call guarding
    private wealth.
 [1200411]The God-created Cow belongs to those who come to ask for
    her.
   They call it outrage on the priests when one retains her as his
    own.
 [1200412]He who withholds the Cow of Gods from Rishis' sons who ask
    the gift
   Is made an alien to the Gods, and subject to the Brahmans'
    wrath:
 [1200413]Then let him seek another Cow, whate'er his profit be in this.
   The Cow, not given, harms a man when he denies her at their
    prayer.
 [1200414]Like a rich treasure stored away in safety is the Brahmans' Cow.
   Therefore men come to visit her, with whomsoever she is born.
 [1200415]So when the Brahmans come unto the Cow they come unto their
    own.
   For this is her withholding, to oppress these in another life.
 [1200416]Thus after three years may she go, speaking what is not under-
    stood.
   He, Narads! would know the Cow, then Brahmans must be
    sought unto.
 [1200417]Whoso calls her a worthless Cow, the stored-up treasure of the
   Gods,
   Bhava and Sarva, both of them, move round and shoot a shaft
    at him.
 [1200418]The man who hath no knowledge of her udder and the teats
    thereof, [p. 99]
   She yields him milk with these, if he hath purposed to bestow
    the Cow.
 [1200419]If he withholds the Cow they beg, she lies rebellious in his stall.
   Vain are the wishes and the hopes which he, withholding her,
    would gain.
 [1200420]The Deities have begged the Cow, using the Brahman as their
    mouth:
   The man who gives her not incurs the enmity of all the Gods.
 [1200421]Withholding her from Brahmans, he incurs the anger of the
    beasts,
   When mortal man appropriates the destined portion of the
   Gods.
 [1200422]If hundred other Brahmans beg the Cow of him who owneth
    her,
   The Gods have said, She, verily, belongs to him who knows the
    truth.
 [1200423]Whoso to others, not to him who hath this knowledge, gives the
   Cow,
   Earth, with the Deities, is hard for him to win and rest upon.
 [1200424]The Deities begged the Cow from him with whom at first she
    was produced:
   Her, this one, Narada would know: with Deities he drove her
    forth.
 [1200425]The Cow deprives of progeny and makes him poor in cattle who
   Retains in his possession her whom Brahmans have solicited.
 [1200426]For Agni and for Soma, for Kama, Mitra and Varuna,
   For these the Brahmans ask: from these is he who giveth not
    estranged.
 [1200427]Long as her owner hath not heard, himself, the verses, let her
    move
   Among his kine: when he hath heard, let her not make her
    home with him;
 [1200428]He who hath heard her verses and still makes her roam among
    his kine.
   The Gods in anger rend away his life and his prosperity
 [1200429]Roaming in many a place the Cow is the stored treasure of the
   Gods,
   Make manifest thy shape and form when she would seek her
    dwelling-place. [p. 100]
 [1200430]Her shape and form she manifests when she would seek her
    dwelling-place;
   Then verily the Cow attends to Brahman priests and their
    request.
 [1200431]This thought he settles in his mind. This safely goeth to the
   Gods.
   Then verily the Brahman priests approach that they may beg the
   Cow
 [1200432]By Svadha to the Fathers, by sacrifice to the Deities,
   By giving them the Cow, the Prince doth not incur the mother's.
    wrath.
 [1200433]The Prince's mother is the Cow: so was it ordered from of old.
   She, when bestowed upon the priests, cannot be given back, they
    say.
 [1200434]As molten butter, held at length, drops down to Agni from the
    scoop,
   So falls away from Agni he who gives no Cow to Brahman
    priests.
 [1200435]Good milker, with rice-cake as calf, she in the world comes
    nigh to him,
   To him who gave her as a gift the Cow grants every hope and.
    wish.
 [1200436]In Yama's realm the Cow fulfils each wish for him who gave her
    up;
   But hell, they say, is for the man who, when they beg, bestow
    her not.
 [1200437]Enraged against her owner roams the Cow when she hath been
    impregned.
   He deemed me fruitless is her thought; let him be bound in,
    snares of Death!
 [1200438]Whoever looking on the Cow as fruitless, cooks her flesh at
    home,
   Brihaspati compels his sons and children of his sons to beg.
 [1200439]Downward she sends a mighty heat, though amid kine a Cow
    she roams.
   Poison she yields for him who owns and hath not given her away.
 [1200440]The animal is happy when it is bestowed upon the priests:
   But happy is the Cow when she is made a sacrifice to Gods.
 [1200441]Narada chose the terrible Vilipti out of all the cows Which the [p. 101]
   Gods formed and framed when they had risen up from sacri-
    fice
 [1200442]The Gods considered her in doubt whether she were a Cow or
    not.
   Mirada spake of her and said, The veriest Cow of cows is she.
 [1200443]How many cows, O Narada, knowest thou, born among man-
    kind
   I ask thee who dost know, of which must none who is no
   Brahman eat?
 [1200444]Vilipti, cow, and she who drops no second calf, Brihaspati!
   Of these none not a Brahmana should eat if he hope for emi-
    nence.
 [1200445]Homage, O Narada, to thee who hast quick knowledge of the
    cows.
   Which of these is the direst, whose withholding bringeth death
    to man?
 [1200446]Vilipti, O Brihaspati, cow, mother of no second calf--Of these
    none not a Brahman should eat if he hope for eminence.
 [1200447]Threefold are kine, Vilipti, cow, the mother of no seeond calf:
   These one should give to priests, and he will not offend Praja-
    pati.
 [1200448]This Brahmans! is your sacrifice: thus should one think when he
    is asked,
   What time they beg from him the Cow fearful in the with-
    holder's house.
 [1200449]He gave her not to us, so spake the Gods, in anger, of the Cow.
   With these same verses they addressed Bheda: this brought
    him to his death.
 [1200450]Solicited by Indra, still Bheda refused to give this Cow.
   In strife for victory the Gods destroyed him for that sin of his.
 [1200451]The men of evil counsel who advise refusal of the Cow,
   Miscreants, through their foolishness, are subjected to Indra's
    wrath.
 [1200452]They who seduce the owner of the Cow and say, Bestow her
    not.
   Encounter through their want of sense the missile shot by
   Rudra's hand.
 [1200453]If in his home one cooks the Cow, sacrificed or not sacrificed.
   Wronger of Gods and Brahmans' he departs, dishonest, from
    the world.

HYMN V

  

On the duty of giving cows to Brahmans, and the sin and danger of withholding the gift

[1200501]Created by toil and holy fervour, found by devotion, resting in
    right;
 [1200502]Invested with truth, surrounded with honour, compassed about
    with glory;
 [1200503]Girt round with inherent power, fortified with faith, protected,
    by consecration, installed at sacrifice, the world her resting-
    place;
 [1200504]Brahma her guide, the Brahman her lord and ruler;
 [1200505]Of the Kshatriya who taketh to himself this Brahman's cow and
    oppresseth the Brahman.
 [1200506]The glory, the heroism, and the favouring fortune depart.
 [1200507]The energy and vigour, the power and might the speech and
    mental strength, the glory and duty;
 [1200508]Devotion and princely sway, kingship and people, brilliance and
    honour, and splendour and wealth;
 [1200509]Long life and goodly form, and name and fame, inbreathing and
    expiration, and sight, and hearing;
 [1200510]Milk and flavour, and food and nourishment, and right and
    truth, and action and fulfilment, and children and cattle;
 [1200511]All these blessings of a Kshatriya depart from him when he
    oppresseth the Brahman and taketh to himself the hhman's
    cow.
 [1200512]Terrible is she this Brahman's cow, and fearfully venomous,
    visibly witchcraft.
 [1200513]In her are all horrors and all death.
 [1200514]In her are all dreadful, deeds, all slaughters of mankind.
 [1200515]This, the Brahman's cow, being appropriated, holdeth bound in
    the fetter of Death the oppressor of the Brahman, the blas-
    phemer of the Gods.
 [1200516]A hundred-killing bolt is she: she slays the Brahman's injurer.
 [1200517]Therefore the Brahmans' cow is held inviolable by the wise.
 [1200518]Running she is a thunderbolt, when driven away she is Vaisva-
    nara;
 [1200519]An arrow when she draweth up her hooves, and Mahadeva when
    she looketh around;
 [1200520]Sharp as a razor when she beholdeth, she thundereth when she
    belloweth. [p. 104]
 [1200521]Death is she when she loweth, and a fierce God when she whis-
    keth her tail;
 [1200522]Utter destruction when she moveth her ears this way and that,
   Consumption when she droppeth water;
 [1200523]A missile when milking, pain in the head when milked;
 [1200524]The taking away of strength when she approacheth, a hand-to-
    hand fighter when roughly touched;
 [1200525]Wounding like an arrow when she is fastened by her mouth,
    contention when she is beaten;
 [1200526]Fearfully venomous when falling, darkness when she hath fallen
    down.
 [1200527]Following him, the Brahman's cow extinguisheth the vital breath
    of the injurer of the Brahman.
 [1200528]Hostility when being cut to pieces, woe to children when the
    portions are distributed,
 [1200529]A destructive missile of Gods when she is being seized,
    misfortune when carried away;
 [1200530]Misery while being additionally acquired, contumely and abuse
    while being put in the stall;
 [1200531]Poison when in agitation, fever when seasoned with condi-
    ments;
 [1200532]Sin while she is cooking, evil dream when she is cooked;
 [1200533]Uprooting when she is being turned round, destruction when she
    hath been turned round;
 [1200534]Discord by her smell, grief when she is being eviscerated: ser-
    pent with poison in its fang when drawn;
 [1200535]Loss of power while sacrificially presented, humiliation when she
    hath been offered;
 [1200536]Wrathful Sarva while being carved. Simida when cut up:
 [1200537]Poverty while she is being eaten. Destruction when eaten.
 [1200538]The Brahman's cow when eaten cuts off the injurer of Brahmans
    both from this world and from the world yonder.
 [1200539]Her slaughter is the sin of witchcraft, her cutting-up is a thunder-
    bolt, her undigested grass is a secret spell.
 [1200540]Homelessness is she when denied her rights.
 [1200541]Having become Flesh-eating Agni the Brahman's cow entereth
    into and devoureth the oppressor of Brahmans.
 [1200542]She sunders all his members, joints, and roots.
 [1200543]She cuts off relationship on the father's side and destroys mater-
    nal kinship. [p. 105]
 [1200544]The Brahman's cow, not restored by a Kshatriya, ruins the
    marriages and all the kinsmen of the Brahman's oppressor.
 [1200545]She makes him houseless, homeless, childless: he is extinguished
    without posterity to succeed him.
 [1200500]46. So shall it be with the Kshatriya who takes to himself the cow
    of the Braman who hath this knowledge.
 [1200547]Quickly, when he is smitten down by death, the clamorous vul-
    tures cry:
 [1200548]Quickly around his funeral fire dance women with dishevelled
    locks,
   Striking the hand upon the breast and uttering their evil shriek.
 [1200549]Quickly the wolves are howling in the habitation where he
    lived:
 [1200550]Quickly they ask about him, What is this? What thing hath
    happened here?
 [1200551]Rend, rend to pieces, rend away, destroy, destroy him utterly.
 [1200552]Destroy Angirasi! the wretch who robs and wrongs the Brah-
    mans, born.
 [1200553]Of evil womb, thou witchcraft hid, for Vaisvadevi is thy name,
 [1200554]Consuming, burning all things up, the thunderbolt of spell and
    charm.
 [1200555]Go thou, becoming Mrityu sharp as razor's edge pursue thy
    course:
 [1200556]Thou bearest off the tyrants' strength, their store of merit, and
    their prayers.
 [1200557]Bearing off wrong, thou givest in that world to him who hath
    been wronged.
 [1200558]O Cow, become a tracker through the curse the Brahman hath
    pronounced,
 [1200559]Become a bolt, an arrow through his sin, be terribly venomous.
 [1200560]O Cow, break thou the head of him who wrongs the Brahmans,
    criminal, niggard, blasphemer of the Gods.
 [1200561]Let Agni burn the spiteful wretch when crushed to death and
    slain by thee.
 [1200562]Rend, rend to bits, rend through and through, scorch and con-
    sume and burn to dust,
 [1200563]Consume thou, even from the root, the Brahmans' tyrant, god-
    like Cow!
 [1200564]That he may go from Yama's home afar into the worlds of sin.
    its [p. 106]
 [1200565]So, Goddess Cow, do thou from him, the Brahmans' tyrant,
    criminal, niggard, blasphemer of the Gods,
 [1200566]With hundred-knotted thunderbolt, sharpened and edged with
    razor-blades,
 [1200567]Strike off the shoulders and the head.
 [1200568]Snatch thou the hair from off his head, and from his body strip
    the skin:
 [1200569]Tear out his sinews, cause his flesh to fall in pieces from his
    frame.
 [1200570]Crush thou his bones together, strike and beat the marrow out
    of him.
 [1200571]Dislocate all his limbs and joints.
 [1200572]From earth let the Carnivorous Agni drive him, let Vayu burn.
    him from mid-air's broad region.
 [1200573]From heaven let Surya drive him and consume him.

HYMN I

  

The glorification of Rohita, a form of Fire and of the Sun

[1300101]Rise, Mighty One, who liest in the waters, and enter this thy
    fair and glorious kingdom.
   Let Rohita who made this All uphold thee carefully nurtured
    for supreme dominion.
 [1300102]The strength that was in waters hath ascended. Mount o'er the
    tribes which thou hast generated.
   Creating Soma, waters, plants and cattle, bring hitherward both
    quadrupeds and bipeds.
 [1300103]Ye Maruts, strong and mighty, sons of Prisni, with Indra for
    ally crush down our foemen.
   Let Rohita, ye bounteous givers, hear you, thrice-seven Maruts
    who delight in sweetness!
 [1300104]Up to the lap of births, to lofty places, hath Rohita, the germ
    of Dames, ascended.
   Conjoined with these he found the six realms: seeing his way
    in front here he received the kingship.
 [1300105]For thee hath Rohita obtained dominion, scattered thine ene-
    mies, become thy safeguard.
   So by the potent Sakvaris let Heaven and Earth be milked to-
     yield thee all thy wishes.
 [1300106]Rohita gave the Earth and Heavens their being. There Para-
    meshthin held the cord extended.
   Thereon reposeth Aja Ekapada. He with his might hath stab-
    lished Earth and Heaven.
 [1300107]Rohita firmly stablished Earth and Heaven: by him was ether
    fixt by him the welkin.
   He measured out mid air and all the regions: by him the Gods
    found life that lasts for ever.
 [1300108]Arranging shoots, springs, Rohita considered this Universe in
    all its forms and phases.
   May he, gone up to heaven with mighty glory, anoint thy sov-
    ranty with milk and fatness. [p. 108]
 [1300109]Thy risings up, thy mountings and ascensions wherewith thou
    fillest heaven and air's mid-region--
   By prayer for these, by milk of these, increasing, in Rohita's
    kingdom watch, among his people.
 [1300110]The tribes thy heat produced have followed hither the Calf and
   Gayatri, the strain that lauds him.
   With friendly heart let them approach to serve thee, and the
   Calf Rohita come with his mother.
 [1300111]Erected, Rohita hath reached the welkin, wise, young, creating
    every form and figure.
   Agni, refulgent with his heightened lustre, in the third realm
    hath brought us joy and gladness.
 [1300112]Thousand-horned Bull, may Jatavedas, worshipped with butter,
    balmed with Soma, rich in heroes,
   Besought, ne'er quit me; may I ne'er forsake thee. Give me
    abundant men and herds of cattle.
 [1300113]Rohita is the sire and mouth of worship: to him with voice, ear,
    heart I pay oblation.
   To Rohita come Gods with joyful spirit. May he by risings raise
    me till I join him.
 [1300114]Rohita ordered sacrifice for Visvakarman: thence have I obta-
    ined this strength and energy.
   May I proclaim thee as my kin over the greatness of the world.
 [1300115]On thee have mounted Brihati and Pankti. and Kakup with great
    splendour, Jatavedas!
   The cry of Vashat with the voice uplifted and Rohita with seed
    on thee have mounted.
 [1300116]He goes into the womb of earth, he robes himself in heaven and
    air.
   He on the Bright One's station hath reached heavenly light and
    all the worlds.
 [1300117]To us, Vachaspati, may Earth be pleasant, pleasant our dwelling,
    pleasant be our couches.
   Even here may Prana be our friend: may Agni, O Parameshthin
    give thee life and splendour.
 [1300118]And those, Vachaspati, our own five seasons, sacred to Visva-
    karman their creator.
   Even here our friend be Prana: Parameshthin, may Rohita
    vouchsafe the life and splendour. [p. 109]
 [1300119]Breed, O Vachaspati, joy and understanding, kine i n our stall
    and children in our consorts.
   Even here may Prana be our friend: may Agni, O Parameshthin,
    give thee life and splendour.
 [1300120]With splendour let God Savitar, and Agni, with splendour
   Mitra, Varuna invest thee.
   Treading down all Malignities, come hither. Pleasant and'
    glorious hast thou made this kingdom.
 [1300121]Rohita, car-borne by a speckled leader, thou, pouring water,.
    goest on in triumph.
 [1300122]Golden, refulgent, lofty is the Lady, Rohini, Rohita's devoted
   Consort.
   Through her may we win various spoil and booty, through her
    be conquerors in every battle.
 [1300123]Rohita's seat is Rohini before us: that is the path the speckled
   Mare pursueth.
   Kasyapas and Gandharvas lead her upward, and heavenly sages
    ever watch and guard her,
 [1300124]Surya's bay steeds refulgent and immortal draw the light-rolling.
    chariot on for ever.
   Drinker of fatness, Rohita, resplendent, hath entered into
    various-coloured heaven,
 [1300125]Rohita, Bull whose horns are sharply pointed, superior of Agni
    and of Surya,
   He who supports the sundered earth and heaven,--from him the
   Gods effect their own creations.
 [1300126]Rohita rose to heaven from mighty ocean, Rohita rose and
    clomb all steeps and rises.
 [1300127]Prepare the Milky One who teems with fatness: she is the Gods'
    never-reluctant milch-cow.
   Indra drink Soma: ours be peace and safety. Let Agni lead the
    laud, and chase our foemen.
 [1300128]Both kindling and inflamed, adored with butter and enhanced
    thereby.
   May conquering Agni, conqueror of all, destroy mine enemies.
 [1300129]Let him smite down in death and burn the foeman who
    attacketh me.
   Our adversaries we consume through Agni the Carnivorous.
 [1300130]Beat them down, Indra, with thy bolt, beat them down, mighty
    with thine arm. [p. 110]
   I through the energy and force of Agni have secured my foes.
 [1300131]Cast down our foes beneath our feet, O Agni. Brihaspati,
    oppress our rebel kinsman.
   Low let them fall, O Indra-Agni. Mitra-Varuna, powerless to
    show their anger.
 [1300132]Ascending up on high, O God. O Surya, drive my foes away.
   Yea, beat them backward with the stone: to deepest darkness
    let them go.
 [1300133]Calf of Viraj, the Bull of prayers and worship, whitebacked, he
    hath gone up to air's mid-region.
   Singing, they hymn the Calf, with gifts of butter: him who is
   Brahma they exalt with Brahma.
 [1300134]Rise up to earth, rise up to heaven above it; rise up to opulence,
    rise up to kingship.
   Rise up to offspring, rise to life immortal; rise, and with Rohita
    unite thy body.
 [1300135]With all the Gods who circle round the Sun, upholding royal
    sway,
   With all of these may Rohita accordant, give sovranty to thee
    with friendly spirit.
 [1300136]Cleansed by prayer, sacrifices bear thee upward: bay coursers,
    ever travelling, convey thee. Thy light shines over sea and
    billowy ocean.
 [1300137]Rohita, conqueror of cows and riches and gathered spoil, is
    heaven's and earth's upholder.
   Over earth's greatness would I tell my kinship with thee who
    hast a thousand births and seven.
 [1300138]A glorious sight to beasts and men, thou goest glorious to the
    regions and mid-regions.
   On earth's, on Aditi's bosom, bright with glory. Fain would I
    equal Savitar in beauty.
 [1300139]Thou, yonder, knowest all things here, when here thou knowest
    what is there.
   From here men see the sphere of light, Surya profoundly wise in
    heaven.
 [1300140]A God, thou injurest the Gods: thou movest in the ocean's
    depth.
   Men kindle common Agni: him only the higher sages know.
 [1300141]Beneath the upper realm, above this lower, bearing her Calf at
    foot, the Cow hath risen [p. 111]
   Whitherward, to what place hath she departed? Where doth she
    calve? Not in this herd of cattle.
 [1300142]She hath become one-footed or two-footed, four-footed, or
    eight-footed or nine-footed,
   This universe's thousand-syllabled Pankti Oceans flow forth
    from her in all directions.
 [1300143]Rising to heaven, immortal, hear my calling. Cleansed by
    prayer, sacrifices bear thee upward. Bay coursers, ever on the
    road, convey thee.
 [1300144]This, O Immortal One, I know of thee, thy progress to the sky
    thy dwelling-place in loftiest heaven.
 [1300145]Beyond the sky, beyond the Earth looks Surya, and beyond the
    floods.
   The single eye of all that is; to mighty heaven hath he arisen.
 [1300146]The earth was made his altar, and the wide expanses were the
    fence.
   There Rohita established both these Agnis, fervent heat and
    cold.
 [1300147]He stablished heat and cold, he made the mountains sacrificial
    posts.
   Then both the Agnis, Rohita's who found celestial light, with
    rain for molten butter, sacrificed.
 [1300148]Rohita's Agni-his who found heaven's light-is kindled with the
    prayer.
   From him the heat, from him the cold, from him the sacrifice
    was born.
 [1300149]Both Agins-Rohita's who found the light of heaven--made
    strong by prayer,
   Waxing by prayer, adored with prayer, by prayer enkindled,
    sacrificed.
 [1300150]One is deposited in Truth, one kindled in the waters: both
   Agnis of Rohita who found the light are set aflame with prayer.
 [1300151]That decked by Wind, and that prepared by Indra Brahman-
    aspati,
   Agnis of Rohita who found light, prayer-enkindled, sacrificed.
 [1300152]Rohita made the earth to be his altar, heaven his Dakshina.
   Then heat he took for Agni, and with rain for molten butter he
    created every living thing.
 [1300153]The earth became an altar, heat was Agni, and the butter rain. [p. 112]
   There Agni made, by song and hymn, these mountains rise and
    stand erect.
 [1300154]Then, having made the hills stand up, Rohita spake to Earth,
    and said:
   In thee let every thing be born, what is and what is yet to be.
 [1300155]This sacrifice, the first of all, the past, the present, had its birth.
   From that arose this universe, yea, all this world of brightness,
    brought by Rohita the heavenly Sage.
 [1300156]If thou should kick a cow, or by indecent act offend the Sun,
   Thy root I sever; nevermore mayst thou cast shadow on the
    ground.
 [1300157]Thou who, between the fire and me, passest across the line of
    shade.
   Thy root I sever: nevermore mayst thou cast shadow on the
    ground.
 [1300158]Whoe'er he be who, Surya, God! comes between thee and me
    to-day,
   On him we wipe away ill-dream, and troubles, and impurity.
 [1300159]Let us not, Indra, leave the path, the Soma-presser's sacrifice.
   Let not malignities dwell with us.
 [1300160]May we obtain, completely wrought, the thread spun out tc
    reach the Gods,
   That perfecteth our sacrifice.

HYMN II

  

The glorification of the Sun as Aditya, Surya and Rohita

[1300201]Radiant, refulgent in the sky are reared the banners of his light,
   Aditya's, who beholdeth man, mighty in act and bountiful.
 [1300202]Let us laud him, the whole world's Herdsman, Surya, who with
    his rays illumines all the regions,
   Mark of the quarters, brightening them with lustre, swift,
    mighty-pinioned, flying in the ocean.
 [1300203]From west to east thou speedest freely, making by magic day
    and night of diverse colours.
   This is Aditya, thy transcendent glory, that thou alone art born
    through all creation.
 [1300204]Victorious, inspired, and brightly shining, whom seven strong
    tawny-coloured coursers carry,
   Whom Atri lifted from the flood to heaven, thus men behold
    thee as thy course thou runnest.
 [1300205]Let them not snare thee speeding on thy journey: pass safely,
    swiftly places hard to traverse,
   While measuring out the day and night thou movest--O Surya,
    even Heaven and Earth the Goddess.
 [1300206]Hail to thy rapid car whereon, O Surya, thou circlest in a
    moment both the limits,
   Whirled by thy bay steeds, best of all at drawing, thy hundred
    horses or seven goodly coursers!
 [1300207]Mount thy strong car, O Surya, lightly rolling, drawn by good
    steeds, propitious, brightly gleaming,
   Whirled by thy bays, most excellent at drawing, thy hundred
    horses or seven goodly coursers.
 [1300208]Surya hath harnessed to his car to draw him seven stately bay
    steeds gay with wolden housings.
   The Bright One started from the distant region: dispelling
    gloom the God hath climbed the heavens.
 [1300209]With lofty banner hath the God gone upward, and introduced
    the light, expelling darkness.
   He hath looked round on all the worlds, the Hero, the son of
   Aditi, Celestial Eagle. [p. 116]
 [1300210]Rising, thou spreadest out thy rays, thou nourishest all shapes
    and forms.
   Thou with thy power illumest both the oceans, encompassing
    all spheres with thy refulgence.
 [1300211]Moving by magic power to east and westward, these two young
    creatures, sporting, circle ocean.
   One of the pair beholds all living creatures: with wheels of gold
    the bay steeds bear the other.
 [1300212]Atri established thee in heaven. O Surya, to create the month.
   So on thou goest, firmly held, heating, beholding all that is.
 [1300213]As the Calf both his parents so thou joinest both the distant
    bounds,
   Surely the Gods up yonder knew this sacred mystery long ago.
 [1300214]Surya is eager to obtain all wealth that lies along the sea,
   Great is the course spread out for him, his eastward and his
    westward path.
 [1300215]He finishes his race with speed and never turns his thought
    aside,
   Thereby he keeps not from the Gods enjoyment of the Drink of
    Life.
 [1300216]His heralds bear him up aloft, the God who knoweth all that
    live,
   Surya, that all may look on him.
 [1300217]The Constellations pass away, like thieves, departing in the
    night.
   Before the all-beholding Sun.
 [1300218]His herald rays are seen afar refulgent o'er the world of men,
   Like flames of fire that burn and blaze.
 [1300219]Swift and all-beautiful art thou, O Surya, maker of the light,
   Illuming all the radiant realm.
 [1300220]Thou goest to the hosts of Gods, thou comest hither to mankind,
   Hither, all light to behold.
 [1300221]With that same eye of thine wherewith thou seest, brilliant
   Varuna.
   The active one among mankind,
 [1300222]Traversing sky and wide mid-air, thou metest with thy beams
    our days,
   Sun, seeing all things that have life.
 [1300223]Seven bay steeds harnessed to thy car bear thee, O thou far-
    seeing One, [p. 117]
   God, Surya, with the radiant hair.
 [1300224]Surya, hath yoked the pure bright seven, the daughters of the
    car, with these,
   His own dear team, he travelleth.
 [1300225]Devout, aflame with fervent heat, Rohita hath gone up to
    heaven.
   He is re-born, returning to his birthplace, and hath become the
   Gods' imperial ruler.
 [1300226]Dear unto all men, facing all directions, with hands and palms
    on every side extended,
   He, the sole God, engendering earth and heaven, beareth them
    with his wings and arms together.
 [1300227]The single-footed hath outstepped the biped, the biped overtakes
    the triple-footed.
   The biped hath outstridden the six-footed: these sit around the
    single-footed's body.
 [1300228]When he, unwearied, fain to go, hath mounted his bays, he
    makes two colours, brightly shining.
   Rising with banners, conquering the regions, thou sendest light
    through all the floods, Aditya.
 [1300229]Verily, Surya, thou art great: truly, Aditya, thou art great.
   Great is thy grandeur, Mighty One: thou, O Aditya, thou art
    great.
 [1300230]In heaven, O Bird, and in mid-air thou shinest: thou shinest on
    the earth and in the waters.
   Thou hast pervaded both the seas with splendour: a God art
    thou, O God, light-winner, mighty.
 [1300231]Soaring in mid-course hither from the distance, fleet and ins-
    pired, the Bird that flies above us,
   With might advancing Vishnu manifested, he conquers all that
    moves with radiant banner:
 [1300232]Brilliant, observant, mighty Lord, an Eagle illuming both the
    spheres and air between them.
   Day and the Night, clad in the robes of Surya, spread forth more
    widely all his hero powers.
 [1300233]Flaming and radiant, strengthening his body, bestowing floods
    that promptly come to meet us,
   He, luminous, winged, mighty, strength-bestower, hath mounted
    all the regions as he forms them. [p. 118]
 [1300234]Bright presence of the Gods, the luminous herald Surya hath
    mounted the celestial regions.
   Day's maker, he hath shone away the darkness, and radiant,
    passed o'er places hard to traverse.
 [1300235]He hath gone up on high, the Gods' bright presence, the eye of
   Mitra, Varuna and Agni.
   The soul of all that moveth not or moveth, Surya hath filled the
    earth and air and heaven,
 [1300236]High in the midst of heaven may we behold thee whom men call
   Savitar, the bright red Eagle,
   Soaring and speeding on thy way, refulgent, unwasting light
    which Atri erst discovered.
 [1300237]Him, Son of Aditi, an Eagle hasting along heaven's height, I
    supplicate in terror,
   As such prolong our lengthened life, O Surya: may we, unha-
    rmed, enjoy thy gracious favour.
 [1300238]This gold-hued Hansa's wings, soaring to heaven, spread o'er a
    thousand days' continued journey
   Supporting all the Gods upon his bosom, he goes his way behold-
    ing every creature.
 [1300239]Rohita, in primeval days Prajapati, was, after, Time, Mouth of
    all sacrifices, he, Rohita, brought celestial light.
 [1300240]He, Rohita, became the world: Rohita gave the heaven its heat.
   Rohita with his beams of light travelled along the earth and sea.
 [1300241]To all the regions Rohita came, the imperial Lord of heaven.
   He watches over ocean, heaven, and earth and all existing things.
 [1300242]Mounting the lofty ones, he, bright, unwearied, splendidly
    shining, makes two separate colours,
   While through all worlds that are he sends his lustre, radiant,
    observant, mighty, wind-approacher.
 [1300243]One form comes on, the other is reverted: to day and night the
   Strong One shapes and fits him.
   With humble prayer for aid we call on Surya, who knows the
    way, whose home is in the region.
 [1300244]The suppliant's way, filling the earth, the Mighty circleth the
    world with eye that none deceiveth.
   May he, all-seeing, well-disposed and holy, give ear and listen to
    the word I utter.
 [1300245]Blazing with light his majesty hath compassed ocean and earth
    and heaven and air's mid-region. [p. 119]
   May he, all-seeing, well-disposed and holy, give ear and listen to
    the word I utter.
 [1300246]Agni is weakened by the people's fuel to meet the Dawn who
    cometh like a milch-cow,
   Like young trees shooting up on high their branches, his flames
    are mounting to the vault of heaven.

   Bird's keen vision penetrateth,
   This God is wroth offended by the sinner who wrongs the
   Brahman who hath gained this knowledge
   Agitate him, O Rohita; destroy him: entangle in thy snares the

HYMN IV

  

A glorification of the Sun as the only Deity

[1300401]Down looking, on the ridge of sky Savitar goes to highest
    heaven.
 [1300402]To misty cloud filled with his rays Mahendra goes encompassed
    round.
 [1300403]Creator and Ordainer, he is Vayu, he is lifted cloud.
 [1300404]Rudra, and Mahadeva, he is Aryaman and Varuna.
 [1300405]Agni is he, and Siirya, he is verily Mahayama.
 [1300406]Calves, joined, stand close beside him, ten in number, with one
    single head.
 [1300407]From west to east they bend their way: when he mounts up he
    shines afar.
 [1300408]His are these banded Maruts: they move gathered close like
    porters' thongs. [p. 125]
 [1300409]To misty cloud filled with his rays Mahendra goes encompassed
    round,
 [1300410]His are the nine supports, the casks set in nine several places
    here.
 [1300411]He keeppeth watch o'er creatures, all that breatheth and that
    breatheth not.
 [1300412]This conquering might hath entered him, He is the sole the
    simple One, the One alone.
 [1300413]In him these Deities become simple and One
 [1300414]Renown and glory, and force and cloud, the Brahman's
    splendour, and food, and nourishment,
 [1300415]To him who knoweth this God as simple and one.
 [1300416]Neither second, nor third, nor yet fourth is he called;
 [1300417]He is called neither fifth, nor sixth, nor yet seventh
 [1300418]He is called neither eighth, nor ninth, nor yet tenth.
 [1300419]He watcheth over creatures, all that breatheth and that breatheth
    not.
 [1300420]This conquering might hath entered him. He is the sole, the
    simple One, the One alone,
 [1300421]In him these Deities become simple and One
 [1300422]Devotion and Religious Fervour, and renown and glory, and
    force and cloud, the Brahman's splendour, and food and
    nourishment.
 [1300423]And past and future, and Faith and lustre, and heaven and sweet
    oblation,
 [1300424]To him who knoweth this God as simple and One.
 [1300425]He, verily, is death, he is immortality, he is the monster, he is
    the fiend.
 [1300426]He is Rudra, winner of wealth in the giving of wealth; in uttering
    homage he is the sacrificial exclamation Vashat duly employed.
 [1300427]All sorcerers on earth obey with reverence his high behest.
 [1300428]All constellations yonder, with the Moon, are subject to his will.
 [1300429]He was brought forth from Day: and Day derives his origin.
    from him.
 [1300430]He was brought forth from Night: and Night derives her origins
    from him.
 [1300431]He was produced from Air: and Air derives its origin from him.
 [1300432]He was produced from Wind: and Wind derives his origin from.
    him. [p. 126]
 [1300433]From Heaven was he produced: and Heaven derives his origin
    from him.
 [1300434]He sprang from regions of the sky: from him the heavenly
    regions sprang.
 [1300435]He is the offspring of the Earth: Earth hath her origin from
    him.
 [1300436]He was produced from fire: and fire derives its origin from
    him.
 [1300437]He is the waters' offspring: and from him the waters were
    produced.
 [1300438]From holy verses was he born: from him the holy verses
    sprang.
 [1300439]He is the son of sacrifice: and sacrifice was born from him.
 [1300440]Sacrifice, sacrifice's Lord, he was made head of sacrifice.
 [1300441]He thundereth, he lighteneth, he casteth down the thunder-stone
 [1300442]For misery or happiness, for mortal man or Asura.
 [1300443]Whether thou formest growing plants, or sendest rain for
    happiness, or hast increased the race of man,
 [1300444]Such is thy greatness, liberal Lord! A hundred bodily forms are
    thine.
 [1300445]Millions are in thy million, or thou art a billion in thyself.
 [1300446]Stronger than immortality is Indra: stronger thou than deaths;
 [1300447]Yea, stronger than Malignity art thou, O Indra, Lord of Might.
   Calling thee Master, Sovran Chief, we pay our reverence to
    thee.
 [1300448]Worship to thee whom all behold! Regard me, thou whom all
    regard,
 [1300449]With food, and fame, and vigour, with the splendour of a
   Brahman's rank
 [1300450]We pay thee reverence calling thee strength, power, and might,
    and conquering force.
 [1300451]We pay thee reverence calling thee red power, the silvery
    expanse.
 [1300452]We pay thee reverence calling thee vast, wide, the good, the
    universe.
 [1300453]We pay thee reverence, calling thee extension, compass, width,
    and world.
 [1300454]We pay thee reverence, calling thee rich, opulent in this and that,
    with wealth unceasing and secure [p. 127]
 [1300455]Worship to thee whom all behold! Regard me, thou whom all
    regard.
 [1300456]With food, and fame, and vigour, with the splendour of a
   Brahman's rank.

HYMN I

  

On the Bridal of Surya, marriage ceremonies in general

[1400101]Truth is the base that bears the earth; by Surya are the heavens
    upheld.
   By Law the Adityas stand secure, and Soma holds his place in
    heaven.
 [1400102]By Soma are the Adityas strong, by Soma mighty is the earth:
   Thus Soma in the lap of all these constellations hath his home.
 [1400103]One thinks, when men have brayed the plant, that he hath drunk
    the Soma's juice.
   Of him whom Brahmans truly know as Soma never mortal eats.
 [1400104]When they begin to drink thee, then, O God, thou swellest out
    again.
   Vayu in Soma's sentinel. The month is that which shapes the
    years.
 [1400105]Soma, preserved by covering rules, guarded by hymns in Brihati,
   Thou standest listening to the stones; none tastes of thee who
    dwells on earth.
 [1400106]Thought was her coverlet, the power of sight was unguent for her
    eyes:
   Her treasure-chest was earth and heaven, when Surya went unto
    her lord.
 [1400107]Raibhi was her dear bridal friend, and Narasatisi led her home.
   Lovely to see was Surya's robe: by Gatha beautified she moves
 [1400108]Songs were the cross-bars of the pole, Kurira metre docked her
    head.
   Both Asvins were the paranymphs: Agni was leader of the
    train.
 [1400109]Soma was he who wooed the maid: the groomsmen were both.
   Asvins, when
   The Sun-God Savitar bestowed his willing Surya on her lord.
 [1400110]Her spirit was the bridal car, the canopy thereof was heaven:
   Two radiant oxen formed the team when Surya came unto her
    lord. [p. 130]
 [1400111]Steadily went the steers upheld by holy verse and song of praise,
   The chariot-wheels were listening ears: thy path was tremulous
    in the sky.
 [1400112]Pure, as thou wentest, were thy wheels, breath was the axle pier-
    cing them.
   Surya advancing to her lord rode on the chariot of her heart.
 [1400113]The bridal pomp of Surya, which Savitar started, moved along.
   In Magha days are oxen slain, in Phalgunis they wed the bride.
 [1400114]When on your three-wheeled chariot, O ye Asvins, ye came as
    suitors unto Surya's bridal,
   Where was one chariot-wheel of yours? Where stood ye for the
    sire's command?
 [1400115]Twin Lords of Lustre, at the time when ye to Surya's wooing
    came,
   Then all the Gods agreed to your proposal Pushan as son elected
    you as father.
 [1400116]Two wheels of thine the Brahmans know, Surya! according to
    their times.
   That which is hidden only those who know the highest truths
    have learned.
 [1400117]Worship we pay to Aryaman, finder of husbands, kindly friend.
   As from its stalk a cucumber, from here I loose thee, not from
    there
 [1400118]Hence and not thence I send her free. I make her softly fettered
    there.
   That, bounteous Indra! she may live blest in her fortune and
    her sons.
 [1400119]Now from the noose of Varuna I free thee, where with the bless-
    ed Savitar hath bound thee.
   May bless be thine together with thy wooer in Order's dwelling,
    in the world of virtue.
 [1400120]Let Bhaga take thy hand and hence conduct thee: let the two
   Asvins on their car transport thee.
   Go to the house to be the household's mistress, and speak as
    lady to thy gathered people.
 [1400121]Happy be thou and prosper with thy children here: be vigilant
    to rule the household in this home.
   Closely unite thy body with this man thy lord. So shalt thou,
    full of years, address thy company. [p. 131]
 [1400122]Be not divided; dwell ye here; reach the full time of human
    life.
   With sons and grandsons sport and play, rejoicing in your happy
    home.
 [1400123]Moving by magic power from east to westward, these children
    twain go sporting round the ocean.
   The one beholds all creatures: thou, the other, art born anew,
    duly arranging seasons.
 [1400124]Thou, born afresh, art new and new for ever; ensign of days,
    before the Dawns thou goest.
   Coming, thou orderest for Gods their portion. Thou lengthenest,
   Moon, the days of our existence.
 [1400125]Give thou the wollen robe away: deal treasure to the Brahman-
    priests.
   This Witchery hath got her feet: the wife attendeth on her lord.
 [1400126]It turneth dusky-red: the witch who clingeth close is driven off.
   Well thrive the kinsmen of this bride: the husband is bound
    fast in bonds.
 [1400127]Unlovely is his body when it glistens with that wicked fiend,
   What time the husband wraps about his limbs the garment of
    his wife.
 [1400128]The butchering, the cutting-up, the severing of limb and joint--
   Behold the forms which Surya wears: yet these the Brahman
    purifies,
 [1400129]Pungent is this, bitter is this, filled as it were with arrow barbs,
    empoisoned and not fit for use.
   The Brahman who knows Surya well deserves the garment of
    the bride.
 [1400130]The Brahman takes away the robe as a fair thing that brings good
    luck.
   He knows the expiating rite whereby the wife is kept unharmed.
 [1400131]Prepare, ye twain, happy and prosperous fortune, speaking the
    truth in faithful utterances.
   Dear unto her, Brihaspati, make the husband, and pleasant be
    these words the wooer speaketh.
 [1400132]Remain ye even here and go no farther: strengthen this man, ye
   Cows, with plenteous offspring.
   May Dawns that come for glory, bright with Soma, here may all
   Gods fix and enchant your spirits. [p. 132]
 [1400133]Come, O ye Cows, with offspring dwell around him: he doth not
    stint the Gods' alloted portion.
   To him, your friend, may Pushan, all the Maruts, to him may
   Dhatar, Savitar send vigour.
 [1400134]Straight in direction be the paths, and thornless, whereby our
    fellows travel to the wooing.
   With Bhaga and with Aryaman Dhatar endue the pair with
    strength!
 [1400135]Whatever lustre is in dice, whatever lustre is in wine,
   Whatever lustre is in cows, Asvins, endue this dame therewith.
 [1400136]With all the sheen that balmeth wine, or thigh of female para-
    mour,
   With all the sheen that balmeth dice, even with this adorn the
    dame.
 [1400137]He who in water shines unfed with fuel, whom sages worship in
    their sacrifices.
   May he, the Waters' Child, send us sweet waters those that en-
    hanced the power of mighty Indra.
 [1400138]I cast away a handful here, hurtful, injurious to health.
   I lift another handful up, sparkling and bringing happiness.
 [1400139]Hither let Brahmans bring her bathing water; let them draw
    such as guards the lives of heroes.
   Aryaman's fire let her encircle, Pushan! Fathers-in-law stand,
    with their sons, expectant.
 [1400140]Blest be the gold to thee, and blest the water, blest the yoke's
    opening, and blest the pillar.
   Blest he the waters with their hundred cleansings: blest be thy
    body's union with thy husband.
 [1400141]Cleansing Apala, Indra! thrice, thou gavest sunbright skin to
    her
   Drawn, Satakratu! through the hole of car, of wagon, and of
    yoke.
 [1400142]Saying thy prayer for cheerfulness, children, prosperity, and
    wealth,
   Devoted to thy husband, gird thyself for immortality.
 [1400143]As vigorous Sindhu won himself imperial lordship of the
    streams,
   So be imperial queen when thou hast come within thy husband's
    home.
 [1400144]Over thy husband's fathers and his brothers be imperial queen. [p. 133]
   Over thy husband's sister and, his mother bear supreme control.
 [1400145]They who have spun, and woven, and extended Goddesses who
    have drawn the ends together,
   May they invest thee for full long existence. Heiress of lengthen-
    ed life, endue this garment,
 [1400146]They mourn the living, they arrange the sacred rite: the men
    have set their thoughts upon a distant cast:
   They who have brought the Fathers this delightful gift, when
    wives allowed their lords the joy of their embrace.
 [1400147]I place upon the lap of Earth the Goddess, a firm auspicious
    stone to bring thee children.
   Stand on it, thou, greeted with joy, resplendent: a long long
    life may Savitar vouchsafe thee.
 [1400148]As Agni in the olden time took the right hand of this our Earth.
   Even so I take and hold thy hand: be not disquieted, with me,
    with children and with store of wealth.
 [1400149]God Savitar shall take thy hand, and Soma the King shall make
    thee rich in goodly offspring,
   Let Agni, Lord Omniscient, make thee happy, till old old age a
    wife unto thy husband.
 [1400150]I take thy hand in mine for happy fortune that thou mayst reach
    old age with me thy consort,
   Gods, Aryaman, Bhaga, Savitar, Purandhi, have given thee to be
    my household's mistress.
 [1400151]Bhaga and Savitar the God have clasped that hand of thine in
    theirs,
   By rule and law thou art my wife: the master of thy house am I.
 [1400152]Be it my care to cherish her: Brihaspati hath made thee mine.
   A hundred autumns live with me thy husband, mother of my
    sons!
 [1400153]Tvashtar, by order of the holy sages, hath laid on her Brihas-
    pati's robe for glory,
   By means of this let Savitar and Bhaga surround this dame, like
   Surya, with her children.
 [1400154]May Indra-Agni, Heaven-Earth, Matarisvan, may Mitra-Varuna,
   Bhaga, both the Asvins,
   Brihaspati, the host of Maruts, Brahma, and Soma magnify this
    dame with offspring.
 [1400155]It was Brihaspati who first arranged the hair on Surya's head, [p. 134]
   And therefore, O ye Asvins, we adorn this woman for her lord.
 [1400156]This lovely form the maiden wears in spirit I long to look on
    as my wife approaching,
   Her will I follow with my nine companions. Who is the sage
    that loosed the bonds that held her?
 [1400157]I free her: he who sees, within my bosom, my heart's nest
    knows how her fair form hath struck me.
   I taste no stolen food: myself untying Varuna's nooses I am
    freed in spirit.
 [1400158]Now from the bond of Varuna I loose thee, wherein the blessed
   Savitar hath bound thee.
   O bride, I give thee here beside thy husband fair space and room
    and pleasant paths to travel.
 [1400159]Lift up your weapons. Drive away the demons. Transport this
    woman to the world of virtue.
   Dilator, most wise, hath found for her a husband. Let him who
    knows, King Bhaga, go before her.
 [1400160]Bhaga hath formed the four legs of the litter, wrought the four
    pieces that compose the frame-work.
   Tvashtar hath decked the straps that go across it, May it be
    blest, and bring us happy fortune.
 [1400161]Mount this, all-hued. gold tinted, strong wheeled, fashioned of
   Kinsuka, this chariot lightly rolling,
   Bound for the world of life immortal, Surya! Made for thy
    lord a happy bride's procession.
 [1400162]To us, O Varuna, bring her, kind to brothers; bring her, Brihas-
    pati, gentle to the cattle.
   Bring her, O Indra, gentle to her husband: bring her to us, O
   Savitar, blest with children.
 [1400163]Hurt not the girl, ye Pillars twain upon the path which Gods
    have made.
   The portal of the heavenly home we make the bride's auspicious
    road.
 [1400164]Let prayer he offered up before and after, prayer in the middle,
    lastly, all around her.
   Reaching the Gods' inviolable castle shine in thy lord's world
    gentle and auspicious.

HYMN II

  

On the Bridal of Surya, marriage ceremonies in general, continued

[1400201]For thee with bridal train they first escorted Surya to her home,
   Give to the husband in return, Agni, the wife with future sons.
 [1400202]Agni hath given the bride again with splendour and a lengthened.
    life.
   Long-lived be he who is her lord: a hundred autumns let him
    live.
 [1400203]She was the wife of Soma first: next the Gandharva was thy
    lord.
   Agni was the third husband: now one born of woman is thy
    fourth.
 [1400204]Soma to the Gandharva, and to Agni the Gandharva gave.
   Now, Agni hath bestowed on me riches and sons and this my
    bride.
 [1400205]Your favouring grace hath come, ye who are rich in spoil!
   Asvins, your longings are stored up within your hearts.
   Ye, Lords of Splendour have become our twofold guard: may
    we as dear friends reach the dwelling of the friend.
 [1400206]Thou, Dame, rejoicing, take with kindly spirit wealth worthy to
    be famed, with all thy heroes.
   Give, Lords of Light a fair ford, good to drink at: remove the
    spiteful stump that blocks the pathway.
 [1400207]May all the Rivers, all the Plants, may all the Forests, all the
   Fields,
   O Bride, protect thee from the fiend, guard his sons' mother for
    her lord. [p. 140]
 [1400208]Our feet are on this pleasant path, easy to travel, bringing bliss,
   Whereon no hero suffers harm, which wins the wealth of other
    men.
 [1400209]Here these my words, ye men, the benediction through which
    the wedded pair have found high fortune.
   May the divine Apsarases, Gandharvas, all they who are these
    fruitful trees' protectors,
   Regard this bride with their auspicious, favour, nor harm the
    nuptial pomp as it advances.
 [1400210]Consumptions, which, through various folk, attack the bride's
    resplendent train,
   These let the holy Gods again bear to the place from which they
    sprang.
 [1400211]Let not the highway thieves who lie in ambush find the wedded
    pair.
   Let wicked men's malignities go elsewhere by an easy path.
 [1400212]I look upon the house and bride's procession with prayer and
    with the gentle eye of friendship.
   All that is covered there in perfect beauty may Savitar make
    pleasant to the husband.
 [1400213]She hath come home this dame come home to bless us: this her
    appointed world hath Dhatar shown her.
   So may Prajapati, and both the Asvins, Aryaman, Bhaga gladden
    her with offspring.
 [1400214]This dame hath come, an animated corn-field: there sow, thou
    man, the seed of future harvest.
   She from her teeming side shall bear thee children, and feed
    them from the fountain of her bosom.
 [1400215]Take thou thy stand, a Queen art thou, like Vishnu here,
   Sarasvati!
   O Sinivali, let her bear children, and live in Bhaga's grace.
 [1400216]So let your wave bear up the pins, and ye, O Waters, spare the
    thongs;
   And never may the holy pair, sinless and innocent, suffer harm.
 [1400217]Not evil-eyed no slayer of thy husband, be strong, mild, kind,
    and gentle to thy household.
   Mother of heroes, love thy husband's father: be happy, and
    through thee may we too prosper.
 [1400218]No slayer of thy husband or his father, gentle and bright, bring
    blessing on the cattle. [p. 141]
   Loving thy husband's father, bring forth heroes. Tend well this
    household fire: be soft and pleasant.
 [1400219]Up and begone! What wish hath brought thee hither from thine
    own house? Thy mightier, I conjure thee.
   Vain is the hope, O Nirriti, that brought thee. Fly off, Malignity;
    stay here no longer.
 [1400220]As first of all this woman hath adored the sacred household
    fire.
   So do thou, Dame, pay homage to the Fathers and Sarasvati.
 [1400221]Take thou this wrapper as a screen, to be a covering for the
    bride
   O Sinivali, let her bear children, and live in Bhaga's grace.
 [1400222]Let her who shall be blest with sons, the maid who finds a.
    husband, step
   Upon the rough grass that ye spread and on the skin ye lay
    beneath.
 [1400223]Over the ruddy-coloured skin strew thou the grass, the Balbuja.
   Let her, the mother of good sons, sit there and serve this Agni
    here.
 [1400224]Step on the skin and wait upon this Agni: he is the God who
    drives away all demons.
   Here bear thou children to this man thy husband: let this thy
    boy be happy in his birthnight.
 [1400225]Let many babes of varied form and nature spring in succession
    from this fruitful mother.
   Wait on this fire, thou bringer of good fortune. Here with thy
    husband serve the Gods with worship.
 [1400226]Bliss-bringer, furthering thy household's welfare, dear gladdening
    thy husband and his father, enter this home, mild to thy hus-
    band's mother.
 [1400227]Be pleasant to the husband's sire, sweet to thy household and thy
    lord,
   To all this clan be gentle, and favour these men's prosperity.
 [1400228]Signs of good fortune mark the bride. Come all of you and look
    at her.
   Wish her prosperity: take on you her evil lucks and go your
    way.
 [1400229]Ye youthful maidens, ill-disposed, and all ye ancient woman
    here, [p. 142]
   Give all your brilliance to the bride, then to your several homes
    depart!
 [1400230]Surya the child of Savitar mounted for high felicity Her litter
    with its cloth of gold, wearing all forms of loveliness.
 [1400231]Rise, mount the bridal bed with cheerful spirit. Here bring forth
    children to this man thy husband.
   Watchful and understanding like Indrani wake thou before the
    earliest light of Morning.
 [1400232]The Gods at first lay down beside their consorts; body with
    body met in close embracement.
   O Dame, like Surya perfect in her grandeur, here rich in future
    children, meet thy husband.
 [1400233]Rise and go hence, Visvavasu: with reverence we worship thee.
   Steal to her sister dwelling with her father: this is the share--
    mark this--of old assigned thee.
 [1400234]Apsarases rejoice and feast together between the sun and place
    of sacrificing.
   These are thy kith and kin: go thou and join them: I in due
    season worship thee Gandharva.
 [1400235]Homage we pay to the Gandharva's favour, obeisance to his eye
    and fiery anger.
   Visvavasu, with prayer we pay thee homage. Go hence to those
   Apsarases thy consorts.
 [1400236]May we be happy with abundant riches. We from this place
    have banished the Gandharva.
   The God is gone to the remotest region, and we have come
    where men prolong existence.
 [1400237]In your due season, Parents! come together. Mother and sire be
    ye of future children.
   Embrace this woman like a happy lover. Raise ye up offspring
    here: increase your riches.
 [1400238]Send her most rich in every charm, O Pushan, her who shall be
    the sharer of my pleasures;
   Her who shall twine her eager arms about me, and welcome all
    my love and soft embraces.
 [1400239]Up, happy bridegroom! with a joyous spirit caress thy wife and
    throw thine arm around her.
   Here take your pleasure, procreate your offspring. May Savitar
    bestow long life upon you. [p. 143]
 [1400240]So may the Lord of Life vouchsafe you children, Aryaman bind
    you, day and night, together.
   Enter thy husband's house with happy omens, bring blessing to
    our quadrupeds and bipeds.
 [1400241]Sent by the Gods associate with Manu, the vesture of the bride,
    the nuptial garment,
   He who bestows this on a thoughtful Brahman, drives from the
    marriage-bed all evil demons.
 [1400242]The priestly meed wherewith ye twain present me, the vesture of
    the bride, the nuptial garment,
   This do ye both, Brihaspati and Indra, bestow with loving-kind-
    ness on the Brahman.
 [1400243]On your soft couch awaking both together, revelling heartily with
    joy and laughter,
   Rich with brave sons, good cattle, goodly homestead, live long to
    look on many radiant mornings.
 [1400244]Clad in new garments, fragrant, well-apparelled, to meet reful-
    gent Dawn have I arisen.
   I, like a bird that quits the egg, am freed from sin and purified.
 [1400245]Splendid are Heaven and Earth, still near to bless us, mighty in
    their power;
   The seven streams have flowed: may they, Goddesses, free us
    from distress
 [1400246]To Surya and the Deities, to Mitra and to Varuna,

   I fasten to this pillar here the burning pest Prishataki.
 [1400249]All witcheries that hang about this garment, all royal Varuna's

    thy house, committing sin with shout and cry,
   May Agni free thee from that guilt, may Savitar deliver thee,
 [1400260]If in thy house thy daughter here have wept, with wild dishevel-

 [1400263]This woman utters wish and prayer, as down she casts the husks
    of corn:
   Long live my lord and master! yea, a hundred autumns let him
    live!
 [1400264]Join thou this couple, Indra! like the Chakravaka and his.
    mate:
   May they attain to full old age with children in their happy

    canopy.
   Each spell to mar the wedding rites, all this we throw into the

   Are pure and meet for sacrifice. May he prolong our lives for
    us.
 [1400268]Now let this artificial comb, wrought with a hundred teeth,
    remove
   Aught of impurity that dims the hair upon this woman's head.
 [1400269]We take away consumption from each limb and member of the
    bride.
   Let not this reach Earth, nor the Gods in heaven, let it not reach
    the sky or air's wide region.
   Let not this dust that sullies reach the Waters, nor Yama, Agni,
    nor the host of Fathers.
 [1400270]With all the milk that is in Earth I gird thee, with all the milk
    that Plants contain I dress thee.
   I gird thee round with children and with riches. Do thou, thus
    girt, receive the offered treasure.
 [1400271]I am this man, that dame art thou I am the psalm and thou the
    verse. I am the heaven and thou the earth.
   So will we dwell together here, parents of children yet to be.
 [1400272]Unmarried men desire to wed; bountiful givers wish for sons.
   Together may we dwell with strength unscathed for high pros-
    perity.
 [1400273]May they, the Fathers who, to view the bride, have joined this
    nuptial train,
   Grant to this lady and her lord children and peaceful happiness.
 [1400274]Her who first guided by a rein came hither, giving the bride, here
    offspring and possessions,
   Let them convey along the future's pathway. Splendid, with
    noble children, she hath conquered.
 [1400275]Wake to long life, watchful and understanding, yea, to a life shall
    last a hundred autumns
   Enter the house to be the household's mistress. A long long life
    let Savitar vouchsafe thee.

HYMN I

  

The hyperbolical glorification of the Vratya or Aryan Non-conformist

[1500101]There was a roaming Vratya. He roused Prajapati to action.
 [1500102]Prajapati beheld gold in himself and engendered it.
 [1500103]That became unique, that became distinguished, that became
    great, that became excellent, that became Devotion, that be-
    came holy Fervour, that became Truth: through that he was
    born.
 [1500104]He grew, he became great, he became Mahadeva.
 [1500105]He gained the lordship of the Gods. He became Lord.
 [1500106]He became Chief Vratya. He held a bow, even that Bow of
   Indra.
 [1500107]His belly is dark-blue, his back is red.
 [1500108]With dark-blue he envelops a detested rival, with red he pierces
    the man who hates him: so the theologians say.

HYMN I

  

An accompaniment to funeral ceremonies and sacrificial offerings to ancestral spirits

[1800101]Fain would I win my friend to kindly friendship. So may the
   Sage, come through the air's wide ocean,
   Remembering the earth and days to follow, obtain a son the
    issue of his father.
 [1800102]Thy friend loves not the friendship which considers her who is
    near in kindred as a stranger.
   Sons of the mighty Asura, the heroes, supporters of the heaven,
    see far around them.
 [1800103]Yea, this the Immortals seek of thee with longing, a scion of the
    only man existing.
   Then let thy soul and mine be knit together. Embrace thy con-
    sort as her loving husband.
 [1800104]Shall we do now what we ne'er did aforetime? we who spoke
    righteously now talk impurely?
   Gandharva in the floods, the Dame of Waters--such is our
    bond, such our most lofty kinship.
 [1800105]Even in the womb God Tvashtar, vivifier, shaping all forms,
   Creator, made us consorts.
   Ne'er are his holy statutes violated: that we are his the heaven
    and earth acknowledge.
 [1800106]Who yokes to-day unto the pole of Order the strong and passio-
    nate steers of checkless spirit,
   With shaft-armed mouths, heart-piercing, joy-bestowing? Long
    shall he live who duly pays them service.
 [1800107]Who knows that earliest day whereof thou speakest, Who hath
    beheld it? Who can here declare it?
   Great is the law of Varuna and Mitra. What, wanton, wilt thou
    say to men to tempt them?
 [1800108]Yami am possessed by love of Yama, that I may rest on the
    same couch beside him.
   I as a wife would yield me to my husband. Like car-wheels let
    us speed to meet each other. [p. 175]
 [1800109]They stand not still, they never close their eyelids, those senti-
    nels of Gods who wander round us.
   Not me--go quickly, wanton, with another, and hasten like a
    chariot-wheel to meet him.
 [1800110]May Surya's eye with days and nights endow him, and ever may
    his light spread out before him.
   In heaven and earth the kindred pair commingle. On Yami be
    the unbrotherly act of Yama.
 [1800111]Sure there will come succeeding times when brothers and sisters
    will do acts unmeet for kinsfolk.
   Not me, O fair one--seek another husband, and make thine arm
    a pillow for thy consort.
 [1800112]Is he a brother when no help is left her? Is she a sister when
   Destruction cometh?
   Forced by my love these many words I utter. Come near, and
    hold me in thy close embraces,
 [1800113]I am no help for thee, no refuge, Yami, I will not clasp and
    press thee to my bosom.
   This is abhorrent to my mind and spirit--a brother on the couch
    beside a sister.
 [1800114]I will not fold mine arms about thy body: they call it sin when
    one comes near a sister.
   Not me--prepare thy pleasure with another. Thy brother seeks
    not this from thee, O fair one.
 [1800115]Alas; thou art indeed a weakling Yama. We find in thee no trace
    o f heart or spirit.
   As round a tree the woodbine clings, another will cling about
    thee girt as with a girdle.
 [1800116]Embrace another, Yami. Let some other, even as the woodbine
    rings a tree, enfold thee.
   Win thou his heart and let him win thy fancy; so make with
    him a bond of blest alliance.
 [1800117]Three hymns the Sages have disposed in order, the many-formed,
    the fair, the all-beholding.
   These in one single world are placed and settled--the growing
    plants, the breezes, and the waters.
 [1800118]The Bull hath yielded for the Bull the milk of heaven: inviolable
    is the Son of Aditi.
   According to his wisdom Varuna knoweth all: he halloweth, the
    holy, times for sacrifice. [p. 176]
 [1800119]Gandharvi spake. May she, the Lady of the Flood amid the
    river's roaring leave my heart untouched.
   May Aditi accomplish all that we desire, and may our eldest
   Brother tell us this as chief.
 [1800120]Yea, even this blessed Morning, rich in store of food, splendid,
    with heavenly lustre, hath shone out for man,
   Since they as was the wish of yearning Gods, brought forth that
    yearning Agni for the assembly as the Priest.
 [1800121]And the fleet Falcon brought for sacrifice from afar this flowing.
    drop most excellent and passing wise,
   Then when the Aryan tribes chose as invoking Priest Agni the
    wonder-worker, and the hymn rose up.
 [1800122]Still art thou kind to him who feeds thee as with grass, and.
    skilled in sacrifice offers thee holy gifts.
   When thou having received the sage's strengthening food with
    lauds, after long toil comest with many more.
 [1800123]Urge thou thy Parents, as a lover, to delight: the lovely One
    desires and craves it from his heart.
   As Priest he calls aloud, as Warrior shows his skill, as Asura tries
    his strength, and with the hymn is stirred.
 [1800124]Far famed is he, the mortal man, O Agni thou Son of strength,
    who hath obtained thy favour.
   He, gathering power, borne onward by his horses, makes his,
    days lovely in his might and splendour.
 [1800125]Hear us, O Agni, in the great assembly: harness thy rapid car,.
    the car of Amrit.
   Bring Heaven and Earth, the Deities' Parents, hither: stay with
    us here, nor from the Gods be absent.
 [1800126]When, holy Agni, the divine assembly, the holy synod mid the
   Gods, is gathered,
   And when thou, godlike One, dealest forth treasures vouchsafe
    us too our portion of the riches.
 [1800127]Agni hath looked upon the van of Mornings, and on the days.
    the earliest Jatavedas.
   After the Dawns, after their rays of brightness, Surya hath enter-
    ed into earth and heaven.
 [1800128]Agni hath looked against the van of Mornings, against the days-
    the earliest Jatavedas;
   In many a place against the beams of Surya, against the heavens
    and earth hath he extended. [p. 177]
 [1800129]Heaven and Earth, first by everlasting Order, speakers of truth,
    are near enough to hear us,
   When the God, urging men to worship, sitteth as Priest, assum-
    ing all his vital vigour.
 [1800130]As God comprising Gods by Law eternal, bear, as the chief who
    knoweth, our oblation,
   Smoke-bannered with the fuel, radiant, joyous, better to praise
    and worship, Priest for ever.
 [1800131]I praise your work .that ye may make me prosper: hear, Heaven
    and Earth, twain worlds that drop with fatness!
   While days and Gods go to the world of spirits, have let the
   Parents with sweet mead refresh us.
 [1800132]When the Cow's nectar wins the God completely, men here
    below are heaven's and earth's sustainers
   All the Gods come to this thy heavenly Yajus which from the
    motley Pair milked oil and water
 [1800133]Hath the King seized us? How have we offended against his
    holy Ordinance? Who knoweth?
   For even Mitra mid the Gods is angry. There are both song and
    wealth for those who come not.
 [1800134]'Tis hard to understand the Immortal's nature, where she who
    is akin becomes a stranger.
   Guard ceaselessly, great Agni, him who ponders Yama's name
    easy to be comprehended.
 [1800135]They in the synod where the Gods rejoice them, where they are
    seated in Vivasvan's dwelling,
   Have given the Moon his beams, the Sun his splendour: the
    two unweariedly maintain their brightness.
 [1800136]The counsel which the Gods meet to consider, their secret plan,
    of that we have no knowledge.
   There let God Savitar, Aditi, and Mitra proclaim to Varuna that
    we are sinless.
 [1800137]Companions, let us learn a prayer to Indra whom the thunder
    arms,
   To glorify your bold and most heroic Friend.
 [1800138]For thou by slaying Vritra art the Vritra-slayer, famed for
    might.
   Thou, Hero, in rich gifts surpassest wealthy chiefs.
 [1800139]O'er the broad land thou goest like a Stega: here on vast earth
    let breezes blow upon us, [p. 178]
   Here hath our dear Friend Varuna, united, like Agni in the
    wood, shot forth his splendour.
 [1800140]Sing praise to him the chariot-borne, the famous, Sovran of men,
    the dread and strong destroyer.
   O Rudra, praised be gracious to the singer; let thy darts spare
    us and smite down another.
 [1800141]The pious call Sarasvati, they worship Sarasvati while sacrifice
    proceedeth.
   The virtuous call Sarasvati to hear them. Sarasvati send bliss to
    him who giveth!
 [1800142]Sarasvati is called on by the Fathers who come right forward to
    our solemn worship.
   Seated upon this sacred grass rejoice you. Give thou us
    strengthening food that brings no sickness.
 [1800143]Sarasvati, who comest with the Fathers, joying in hymns, O
   Goddess, and oblations,
   Give plenteous wealth to this the sacrificer, a portion, worth a
    thousand, of refreshment.
 [1800144]May they ascend, the lowest, highest, midmost, the Fathers, who
    deserve a share of Soma.
   May they who have attained to life, the Fathers, righteous and
    gentle, aid us when we call them.
 [1800145]I have attained the gracious-minded Fathers, I have gained son
    and progeny from Vishnu.
   They who enjoy pressed juices with oblation, seated on sacred
    grass, come oftenest hither.
 [1800146]Now be this homage offered to the Fathers, to those who passed
    of old and those who followed,
   Those who have rested in the earthly region and those who
    dwell among the happy races.
 [1800147]Matali prospers there with Kavyas, Yama with Angiras' sons,
   Brihaspati with singers.
   Exalters of the Gods, by Gods exalted, aid us those Fathers in
    our invocations?
 [1800148]Yes, this is good to taste and full of sweetness, verily it is strong
    and rich in flavour.
   No one may conquer Indra in the battle when he hath drunken
    of the draught we offer.
 [1800149]Honour the King with your oblations, Yama, Vivasvan's son, who
    gathers men together. [p. 179]
   Even him who travelled o'er the mighty rivers, who searches out
    and shows the path to many.
 [1800150]Yama first found for us the road to travel: this pasture never
    can be taken from us.
   Men born on earth tread their own paths that lead them whither
    our ancient Fathers have departed.
 [1800151]Fathers who sit on sacred grass, come, help us: these offsprings
    have we made for you; accept them.
   So come to us with most auspicious favour: bestow on us
    unfailing health and plenty.
 [1800152]Bowing their bended knees and seated southward let all accept
    this sacrifice with favour.
   Punish us not for any sin, O fathers which we through human
    frailty have committed.
 [1800153]Tvashtar prepares the bridal for his daughter: therefore the
    whole of this our world assembles.
   But Yama's mother, spouse of great Vivasvan, vanished as she
    was carried to her dwelling.
 [1800154]Go forth, go forth upon the homeward pathways whither our
    sires of old have gone before us.
   Then shalt thou look on both the Kings enjoying their sacred
    food, God Varuna and Yama.
 [1800155]Go hence, depart ye, fly in all directions. This world for him the
   Fathers have provided.
   Yama bestow upon this man a dwelling adorned with days and
    beams of light and waters.
 [1800156]We set thee down with yearning, and with yearning we enkindle
    thee,
   Yearning, bring yearning Fathers nigh to eat the food of
    sacrifice.
 [1800157]We, splendid men, deposit thee, we, splendid men, enkindle thee.
   Splendid, bring splendid Fathers nigh to eat the sacrificial food.
 [1800158]Our Fathers are Angirases, Navagvas, Atharvans, Bhrigus, who
    deserve the Soma.
   May these, the holy, look on us with favour; may we enjoy
    their gracious loving-kindness.
 [1800159]Come, Yama, with Angirases, the holy; rejoice thee here with
    children of Virupa.
   Seated on sacred grass at this oblation: I call Vivasvan too, thy
    father, hither. [p. 180]
 [1800160]Come, seat thee on this bed of grass. O Yama, accordant with
   Angirases and Fathers.
   Let texts recited by the sages bring thee. O. King, let this
    oblation make thee joyful.
 [1800161]He hath gone hence and risen on high mounting heaven's ridges
    by that path
   Whereon the sons of Angiras, the conquerors of earth, went up.

[p. 184]

  

HYMN II

  

A funeral hymn, taken mainly from the Rigveda

[1800201]For Yama Soma juice flows clear, to Yama is oblation paid.
   To Yama sacrifice prepared, and heralded by Agni, goes.
 [1800202]Offer to Yama sacrifice most sweet in savour and draw near.
   Bow down before the Rishis of the olden time, the ancient ones
    who made the path.
 [1800203]Offer to Yama, to the King, butter and milk in sacrifice.
   So may he grant that we may live long days of life mid living
    men,
 [1800204]Burn him not up, nor quite consume him, Agni. Let not his
    body or his skin be scattered.
   O Jatavedas, when thou hast matured him, then send him on
    his way unto the Fathers.
 [1800205]When thou hast made him ready, Jatavedas, then do thou give
    him over to the Fathers. [p. 185]
   When he attains unto the life that waits him he will obey the
   Deities' commandment.
 [1800206]With the three jars Brihat alone makes pure the six wide-spread-
    ing realms.
   The Gayatri, the Trishtup, all metres in Yama are contained.
 [1800207]The Sun receive thine eye, the wind thy spirit; go, as thy merit
    is, to earth or heaven.
   Go, if it be thy lot, unto the waters: go, make thy home in
    plants with all thy members.
 [1800208]Thy portion is the goat: with heat consume him: let thy fierce
    flame, thy glowing splendour, burn him.
   With thine auspicious forms, O Jatavedas, bear this man to the
    region of the pious.
 [1800209]Let all thy rapid flames, O Jatavedas, wherewith thou fillest
    heaven and earth's mid-region,
   Follow the goat as he goes on, united: then with the others,
    most auspicious, aid us.
 [18002110]Away O Agni, to the Fathers, send him who, offered in thee,
    goes with our oblations.
   Wearing new life let him approach his offspring, and splendid, be
    invested with a body,
 [1800211]Run and outspeed the two dogs, Sarama's offspring, brindled,
    four-eyed, upon thy happy pathway.
   Draw nigh thou to the gracious-minded Fathers who take their
    pleasure in the feast with Yama.
 [1800212]And those two dogs of thine, Yama, the watchers, four-eyed
    who look on men and guard the pathway
   Entrust this man, O King, to their protection, and with prosperity
    and health endow him.
 [1800213]Dark-hued, insatiate, with distended nostrils, Yama's two envoys
    roam among the people.
   May they restore to us a fair existence here and to-day that we
    may see the sunlight.
 [1800214]For some the Soma juice runs clear some sit by sacrificial oil.
   To those for whom the meath flows forth, even to those let him
    depart.
 [1800215]Let him, O Yama, go to those Rishis austere, of Fervour born,
   First followers of Law, the sons of Law, upholders of the Law.
 [1800246]Invincible through Fervour, they who by their Fervour went to
    heaven. [p. 186]
   Who practised great austerity,--even to those let him depart.
 [1800217]The heroes who contend in war and boldly cast their lives away.
   Or who give guerdon thousandfold,--even to those let him
    depart.
 [1800218]Let him, O Yama, go to those Rishis austere, of Fervour born,
   Skilled in a thousand ways and means, the sages who protect the
   Sun.
 [1800219]Be pleasant unto him, O Earth, thornless and lulling him to rest.
   Vouchsafe him shelter broad and sure.
 [1800220]In the free amplitude of earth take roomy space to lodge thee in.
   Let all oblations which in life thou paidest drop thee honey now.
 [1800221]Hither I call thy spirit with my spirit. Come thou; delighted,
    to these dwelling-places.
   Unite thee with the Fathers and with Yama: strong and
    delicious be the winds that fan thee.
 [1800222]Floating in water, bringing streams, let Maruts carry thee aloft,
   And causing coolness by their rush sprinkle thee with their fall-
    ing rain.
 [1800223]I have recalled thy life to life, to being, power, and energy.
   Let thy soul go unto its own: so to the Fathers hasten thou.
 [1800224]Let not thy soul be left behind: here let not aught of thee
    remain,
   Of spirit, body, members, sap.
 [1800225]Let not a tree oppness thee, nor Earth the great Goddess weigh
    thee down.
   Among the Fathers find thy home, and thrive mid those whom
   Yama rules.
 [1800226]Each parted member, severed from thy body, thy vital breaths
    that in the wind have vanished,
   With all of these, piece after piece, shall Fathers who dwell to-
    gether meet and reunite thee.
 [1800227]Him have the living banished from their houses: remove him to
    a distance from the hamlet.
   Yama's observant messenger was Mrityu he hath despatched
    men's lives unto the Fathers.
 [1800228]Those Dasyus who, not eating our oblations, come wilh friends'
    faces mingled with the Fathers,
   Those who wear gross those who wear subtile bodies,--from this.
    our sacrifice let Agni blast them. [p. 187]
 [1800229]Bringing delight, prolonging our existence, here let our own, the
   Fathers, dwell together.
   Coming with sacrifice may we assist them, living long lives
    through many autumn seasons.
 [1800230]Now by this cow I bring thee, by the boiled rice set in milk for
    thee,
   Be the supporter of the folk left here without a livelihood.
 [1800231]Prolong the pleasant Dawn enriched with horses-or bearing us.
    anew beyond the darkness.
   Adjudged to die be he, the man who slew thee: this portion let
    him find, and not another.
 [1800232]Yama is higher and Vivasvan lower: nothing whatever do I see
    above him.
   This sacrifice of mine is based on Yama, Vivasvan spread the
    atmosphere about us.
 [1800233]From mortal men they hid the immortal Lady, made one like
    her and gave her to Vivasvan.
   Saranyu brought to him the Asvin brothers, and then deserted
    both twinned pairs of children.
 [1800234]Bring thou the Fathers one and all Agni, to eat the sacrifice.
   The buried, and the cast away, those burnt with fire, and those
    exposed.
 [1800235]Those, whether flames have burnt or not consumed them, who in
    the midst of heaven enjoy oblations--
   Let them, when thou dost know them, Jatavedas, accept with
    sacred food the axe and worship.
 [1800236]Burn gently, Agni, burn not up the body with too fervent heat.
   Let all thy force and fury be expended on the woods and earth.
 [1800237]I give this place to him who hath come hither and now is mine,
    to be a home to rest in:
   This was the thought of Yama when he answered: This man is.
    mine. Let him come here to riches.
 [1800238]This date we settle once for all, that it may ne'er be fixt again_
   A hundred autumns; not before.
 [1800239]This date we order, etc.
 [1800240]This date we limit, etc.
 [1800241]This date we measure, etc.
 [1800242]This date we mete out, etc.
 [1800243]This date we stablish, etc.
 [1800244]This date we mete and measure out, that it may ne'er be fixt. [p. 188]
    again. A hundred autumns: not before.
 [1800245]The period I have measured--come to heaven. I would my life
    were long
   Not to be measured out again; a hundred autumns, not before.
 [1800246]Inbreath and outbreath, breath diffused, life, sight to look upon
    the Sun
   Seek by a straight unwinding path the Fathers whom King
   Yama rules,
 [1800247]Unmarried men who toiled and have departed, the childless,
    having left their foes behind them,
   Have found on high the world whereto they mounted, reflecting
    on the ridge of vaulted heaven.
 [1800248]The lowest is the Watery heaven, Pilumati the middlemost;
   The third and highest, that wherein the Fathers dwell, is called
   Pradyaus.
 [1800249]The Fathers of our Father, his Grandfathers, those who have
    entered into air's wide region,
   Those who inhabit earth or dwell in heaven, these Fathers will
    we worship with oblation.
 [1800250]Thou seest now, and ne'er again shalt look upon, the Sun in
    heaven.
   Cover him as a mother draws her skirt about her son, O Earth!
 [1800251]This once,,and at no other time hereafter in a lengthened life:
   Cover him, as a wife, O Earth, covers her husband with her
    robe!
 [1800252]Round thee auspiciously I wrap the vesture of our Mother
   Earth:
   Be bliss among the living mine, oblation mid the Fathers thine!
 [1800253]Ye have prepared, pathmakers, Agni-Soma, a fair world for the
   Gods to be the it treasure.
   Go to that world and send us Pushan hither to bear us on the
    paths the goat hath trodden.
 [1800254]Guard of the world, whose cattle ne'er are injured, may Pushan
    bear thee hence, for he hath knowledge.
   May he consign thee to these Fathers' keeping, and to the
    gracious Gods let Agni give hee.
 [1800255]Lord of all life, let Ayu guard thee, Pushan convey thee forward
    on the distant pathway.
   May Savitar the God conduct thee thither where dwell the pious
    who have gone before thee. [p. 189]
 [1800256]For thee I yoke these carriers twain to bear thee to the spirit.
    world.
   Hasten with them to Yama's home and join his gathered.
    companies.
 [1800257]This is the robe that first was wrapped about thee: cast off the
    robe thou worest here among us.
   Go, knowing, to the meed of virtuous action, thy many gifts.
    bestowed upon the friendless.
 [1800258]Mail thee with flesh against the flames of Agni; encompass thee
    about with fat and marrow;
   So will the bold One eager to attack thee with fierce glow fail to
    girdle and consume thee.
 [1800259]From his dead hand I take the staff he carried, together with his
    lore and strength and splendour.
   There art thou, there; and here with good men round us may
    we o'ercome all enemies and foemen.
 [1800260]From his dead hand I take the bow he carried, together with his.
    power and strength and splendour.
   Having collected wealth and ample treasure, come hither to the-
    world of living beings.

HYMN III

  

A funeral hymn, taken partly from the Rigveda

[1800301]Choosing her husband's world, O man, this woman lays herself
    down beside thy lifeless body. [p. 192]
   Preserving faithfully the ancient custom. Bestow upon here both
    wealth and offspring.
 [1800302]Rise, come unto the world of life, O woman: come, he is lifeless
    by whose side thou liest.
   Wifehood with this thy husband was thy portion who took thy
    hand and wooed thee as a lover.
 [1800303]I looked and saw the youthful dame escorted, the living to the
    dead: I saw them, bear her.
   When she with blinding darkness was enveloped, then did I turn
    her back and lead her homeward.
 [1800304]Knowing the world of living beings, Aghnya! treading the path.
    of Gods which lies before thee,
   This is thy husband: joyfully receive him and let him mount
    into the world of Svarga.
 [1800305]The speed of rivers craving heaven and cane, thou, Agni, art the
    waters' gall.
 [1800306]Cool, Agni, and again refresh the spot which thou hast scorched
    and burnt.
   Here let the water-lily grow, and tender grass and leafy plant.
 [1800307]Here is one light for thee, another yonder: enter the third and
    be therewith united.
   Uniting with a body be thou lovely, dear to the Gods in their
    sublimest mansion.
 [1800308]Rise up, advance, run forward: make thy dwelling in water
    that shall be thy place to rest in
   There dwelling in accordance with the Fathers delight thyself
    with Soma and libations.
 [1800309]Prepare thy body: speed thou on thy journey: let not thy limbs,.
    thy frame be left behind thee.
   Follow to its repose thy resting spirit: go to whatever spot of
    earth thou lovest.
 [1800310]With splendour may the Fathers, meet for Soma, with mead and.
    fatness may the Gods anoint me.
   Lead me on farther to extended vision, and prosper me through
    life of long duration.
 [1800311]May Agni balm me thoroughly with splendour; may Vishnu.
    touch my lips with understanding.
   May all the Deities vouchsafe me riches, and pleasant Waters
    purify and cleanse me. [p. 193]
 [1800312]Mitra and Varuna have stood about me. Adityas, Sacirifical
   Posts exalt me!
   May Indra balm my hands with strength and splendour. A long,
    long life may Savitar vouchsafe me.
 [1800313]Worship with sacrificial gift King Yama, Vivasvan's son who
    gathers men together,
   Yama who was the first to die of mortals, the first who travelled
    to the world before us.
 [1800314]Depart, O Fathers, and again come hither; this sacrifice of yours
    is balmed with sweetness.
   Enrich us here with gift of great possessions; grant blessed
    wealth with ample store of heroes.
 [1800315]Kanva, Kakshivan, Purumidha, Agastya, Syavasva Sobhari, and
   Archananas,
   This Visvamitra, Jamadagni, Atri, Kasyapa, Vamadeva be our
    helpers!
 [1800316]Vasishtha, Jamadagni, Visvamitra, Gotama, Vamadeva, Bhara-
    dvaja!
   Atri hath won your favour with homage. Gracious to us be ye
    praiseworthy Fathers.
 [1800317]They, making for themselves a new existence, wash off defilement
    in the brazen vessel.
   May we be fragrant in our houses, ever increasing in our
    children and our riches.
 [1800318]They balm him, balm him over, balm him thoroughly, caress
    the mighty power and balm it with the mead,
   They seize the flying steer at the stream's breathing-place:
    cleansing with gold they grasp the animal herein.
 [1800319]Fathers, be glorious in yourselves, and follow all that is glad in
    you and meet for Soma.
   Give ear and listen, swiftly-moving Sages, benevolent, invoked in
    our assembly.
 [1800320]Atris, Angirases, Navagvas, givers of liberal gifts, continual
    sacrificers,
   Devout and pious, granting guerdon freely, sit on this holy grass
    and be ye joyful.
 [1800321]As in the days of old our ancient Fathers, speeding the work of
    sacred worship, Agni!
   Sought pure light and devotion, singing praises, they cleft the
    ground and made red Dawns apparent. [p. 194]
 [1800322]Gods, doing holy acts, devout, resplendent, smelting like ore
    their human generation,
   Brightening Agni and exalting Indra, they came encompassing
    the stall of cattle.
 [1800323]Strong One! he marked them, and the gods before them, like
    herds of cattle in a foodful pasture.
   There man moaned forth their strong desires, to strengthen even
    the true; the nearest One, the living.
 [1800324]We have worked for thee, we have toiled and laboured: bright
   Dawns have shed their light upon our worship.
   All that the Gods regard with love is blessed. Loud may we
    speak, with heroes, in assembly.
 [1800325]From eastward Indra, Lord or Maruts, guard me, as in her
    arms Earth guards the heaven above us!
   Those who give room, who made the paths, we worship, you,
    mid the Gods, who share the gifts we offer.
 [1800326]Dhatar with Nirriti save me from southward, etc. (as in stanza
   25).
 [1800327]From westward Aditi was Adityas save me! etc.
 [1800328]From westward with the All-Gods save me Soma! etc.
 [1800329]May the strong firm Sustainer bear thee upright, as Savitar bears
    light above the heaven.
   Those who give room, who made the paths, we worship, you
    mid the Gods, whe share the gifts we offer.
 [1800330]Toward the eastward region I supply thee before thou goest
    homeward, with oblation, as in her arms, etc. (as in stanza 25).
 [1800331]Toward the southern region, etc.
 [1800332]Toward the western region, etc.
 [1800333]Toward the northern region, etc.
 [1800334]Toward the stedfast region, etc.
 [1800335]Toward the upmost region I supply thee, before thou goest
    homeward, with oblation, as in her arms Earth bears the
    heaven above us.
   Those who give room, who made the paths, we worship, you,
    mid the Gods, who share the gifts we offer.
 [1800336]Thou art the Bull, Supporter, and Upholder,
 [1800337]Who purifiest wind and mead and water.
 [1800338]From this side and from that let both assist me. As, speeding,
    ye have come like two twin sisters, [p. 195]
   Religious-hearted votaries brought you forward. Knowing your
    several places be ye seated.
 [1800339]Sit near, sit very near beside our Soma: for you I fit the ancient
    prayer with homage.
   The praise-song, like a chieftain on his pathway, spreads far and
    wide. Let all Immortals hear it.
 [1800340]Three paces hath the stake gone up, and followed her, the four-
    footed, with devout observance.
   He with the Syllable copies the praise-song; he thoroughly
    purifies at Order's centre.
 [1800341]Chose he then, death for Gods to be their portion? Why chose
    he not for men a life eternal?
   Brihaspati span sacrifice, the Rishi; and Yama yielded up his
    own dear body.
 [1800342]Thou, Agni Jatavedas, when entreated, didst bear our offerings,
    having made them fragrant.
   And give them to the Fathers who consumed them with Svadha.
   Eat, thou God, the gifts we bring thee.
 [1800343]Lapped in the bosom of the purple Mornings, give riches to the
    man who brings oblations.
   Grant to your sons a portion of that treasure, and, present, give
    them energy, O Fathers.
 [1800344]Fathers whom Agni's flames have tasted, come ye nigh: in per-
    fect order take ye each your proper place.
   Eat sacrificial food presented on the grass: grant riches with a
    multitude of hero sons.
 [1800345]May they, the Fathers who deserve the Soma, invited to their
    favourite oblations.
   Laid on the sacred grass, come nigh and listen. May they be
    gracious unto us and bless us.
 [1800346]Our Father's Fathers and their sires before them who came,
    most noble, to the Soma banquet,
   With these let Yama, yearning with the yearning, rejoicing eat
    our offerings at his pleasure.
 [1800347]Come to us, Agni, with the gracious Fathers who dwell in glow-
    ing light, the very Sages,
   Who thirsted mid the Gods, who hasten hither, oblation-winners,
    theme of singers' praises.
 [1800348]Come, Agni, come with countless ancient Fathers, dwellers in
    light, primeval, God-adorers, [p. 196]
   Eaters and drinkers of oblation, truthful, who travel with the
   Deities and Indra.
 [1800349]Betake thee to the lap of Earth, our mother, of Earth far-spread-
    ing, very kind and gracious.
   May she, wool-soft unto the guerdon-giver, guard thee in front
    upon the distant pathway.
 [1800350]Heave thyself, Earth, nor press him downward heavily: afford
    him easy access pleasant to approach,
   Cover him as a mother wraps her skirt about her child, O
   Earth!
 [1800351]Now let the heaving earth be free from motion: yea, let a
    thousand clods remain above him.
   Be they to him a home distilling fatness: here let them ever be
    his place of refuge.
 [1800352]I stay the earth from thee, while over thee I place this piece of
    earth. May I be free from injury.
   The Fathers firmly fix this pillar here for thee; and there let
   Yama make thee an abiding-place.
 [1800353]Forbear, O Agni, to upset this chalice: the Gods and they who
    merit Soma love it.
   This cup, yea this which serves the Gods to drink from,--in this
    let the Immortals take their pleasure.
 [1800354]The chalice brimming o'er which erst Atharvan offered to Indra,
   Lord of wealth and treasure,
   Indu therein sets draught of virtuous action, and ever purifies
    himself within it.
 [1800355]What wound soe'er the dark bird hath inflicted, the emmet, or
    the serpent, or the jackal,
   May Agni who devoureth all things heal it, and Soma, who hath
    passed into the Brahmans.
 [1800356]The plants of earth are rich in milk, and rich in milk is this my
    milk.
   With all the milky essence of the Waters let them make me
    clean.
 [1800357]Let these unwidowed dames with goodly husbands adorn them-
    selves with fragrant balm and unguent.
   Decked with fair jewels, tearless, free, from trouble, first let the
    dames go up to where he lieth.
 [1800358]Meet Yama, meet the Fathers, meet the merit of virtuous action
    in the loftiest heaven. [p. 197]
   Leave sin and evil, seek anew thy dwelling: so bright with glory
    let him join his body.
 [1800359]Our Father's Fathers and their sires before them, they who have
    entered into air's wide region,
   For them shall self-resplendent Asuniti form bodies now accord-
    ing to her pleasure.
 [1800360]Let the hoar-frost be sweet to thee. sweetly on thee the rain
    descend!
   O full of coolness, thou cool Plant, full of fresh moisture, fresh-
    ening Herb,
   Bless us in waters, female Frog: calm and allay this Agni here.
 [1800361]Vivasvan make us free from fear and peril, good rescuer, quick-
    pouring, bounteous giver!
   Many in number be these present heroes! Increase of wealth be
    mine in kine and horses!
 [1800362]In immortality Vivasvan set us! Go from us Death, come to us
    life eternal!
   To good old age may he protect these people: let not their
    spirits pass away to Yama.
 [1800363]The Sage of Fathers, guardian of devotions who holds thee up
    with might in air's mid-region,--
   Praise him ye Visvamitras, with oblation. To lengthened life
    shall be, this Yama, lead us.
 [1800364]Mount and ascend to highest heaven, O Rishis: be ye not afraid.
   Soma-drinkers to you is paid this Soma-lover's sacrifice. We
    have attained the loftiest light.
 [1800365]Agni is shining forth with lofty banner: the Bull is bellowing to
    earth and heaven.
   From the sky's limit even hath he stretched near us: the Steer
    hath waxen in the waters' bosom.
 [1800366]They gaze on thee with longing in their spirit, as on an eagle
    that is mounting skyward;
   On thee with wings of gold, Varuna's envoy, the Bird that
    hasteth to the home of Yama.
 [1800367]O Indra, bring us wisdom as a sire gives wisdom to his sons.
   Guide us, O much-invoked in this our way: may we still living
    look upon the Sun.
 [1800368]Let these which Gods have held for thee, the beakers covered
    o'er with cake,
   Be full of sacred food for thee, distilling fatness, rich in mead. [p. 198]
 [1800369]Grains which for thee I scatter, mixt with Sesamum, as holy
    food,
   May they for thee be excellent and potent: King Yama look on
    them as thine with favour!
 [1800370]O Tree, give back again this man who is deposited on thee.
   That he may dwell in Yama's home addressing the assemblies
    there.
 [1800371]Seize hold O Jatavedas; let thy flame be full of fervent heat.
   Consume his body: to the world of pious ones transport this
    man.
 [1800372]To these, thy Fathers who have passed away at first and after-
    ward,
   Let the full brook of butter run, o'erflowing with a hundred
    streams.
 [1800373]Mount to this life, removing all defilement: here thine own
    kindred shine with lofty splendour.
   Depart thou; be not left behind: go forward, first of those here,
    unto the world of Fathers.

[p. 201]

  

HYMN IV

  

A funeral hymn, composed partly of verses from the Rigveda

[1800401]Rise to your mother, flames of Jatavedas! I send you up by
    paths which Fathers traverse.
   With headlong speed the Oblation bearer bore our gifts: toil ye,
    and place the offerer where the righteous dwell.
 [1800402]The Seasons, Deities, form and order Worship, butter, cake,
    ladles, sacrificial weapons.
   Tread thou God-travelled paths whereby the righteous, payers
    of sacrifices, go to Svarga.
 [1800403]Carefully look on Sacrifice's pathway whereon the Angirases,
    the righteous, travel.
   By those same pathways go thou up to Svarga where the
   Adityas take their fill of sweetness, There make thy home in
    the third vault of heaven,
 [1800404]Three eagles in the region's roar are standing high on heaven's
    ridge in their appointed station.
   The worlds of Svarga shall, filled full of Amrit, yield food and
    power to him who sacrificeth. [p. 202]
 [1800405]Upabhrit stablished air, Juhu the heaven, Dhruva supported
    earth securely founded.
   As meed, the Svarga worlds, o'erspread with fatness shall yield
    the sacrificer all his wishes.
 [1800406]Dhruva, ascend thou earth the all sustainer: go thou, O Upa-
    bhrit, to air's mid-region.
   Juhu, go skyward with the sacrificer; go, and with Sruva be thy
    calf beside thee drain all the swelling unreluctant quarters.
 [1800407]They ford the mighty rivers by the pathway which they who
    sacrifice, the righteous, travel.
   There they gave room unto the sacrificer when they made regions
    and existing creatures.
 [1800408]The Angirases' pathway is the eastern Agni, the Adityas' path-
    way is the Garhapatya:
   The southward Agni is the way of Southerns.
   To Agni's greatness whom the prayer divideth go powerful, un-
    scathed with all thy members.
 [1800409]Eastward let east fire happily consume thee, and westward
    happily the Garhapatya.
   Burn southern fire, thine armour and protection: from air's-
    mid-region from the north and centre, on all sides, Agni,
    guard thou him from horror.
 [1800410]Do ye, with your most kindly forms, O Agni, waft, turned to
    rapid steeds whose ribs bear burthens,
   The sacrificer to the world of Svarga where with the Gods they
    banquet and are joyful.
 [1800411]Happily from the rear burn this man, Agni, happily from before,
    above, and under.
   One, triply parted, Jatavedas, place him happily in the world
    that holds the righteous.
 [1800412]Happily lit, let fires, each Jatavedas, seize on Prajapati's appoint-
    ed victim.
   Let them not cast it down while here they cook it.
 [1800413]Sacrifice, duly offered, comes preparing the sacrificer for the.
    world of Svarga,
   Let all the fires, each Jatavedas, welcome Prajapati's completely
    offered victim.
   Let them not cast it down while here they cook it.
 [1800414]Fain to fly up from the sky's ridge to heaven, the worshipper
    hath mounted visible Agni. [p. 203]
   Lucid from out the mist to him, the pious, gleams the God-
    travelled path that leads to Svarga.
 [1800415]On thy right hand let Indra be thy Brahman, Brihaspati Adh-
    varyu Agni Hotar.
   This ordered sacrifice goes offered thither whither presented
    gifts have gone aforetime.
 [1800416]Enriched with cake and milk here let the Charu rest.
   World-makers, makers of the path we worship you of the Gods
    who here partake oblations.
 [1800417]Enriched with cake and curds, etc. (as in stanza 16).
 [1800418]Enriched with cake and drops, etc.
 [1800419]Enriched with cake and butter, etc.
 [1800420]Enriched with cake and flesh, etc.
 [1800421]Enriched with cake and food, etc.
 [1800422]Enriched with cake and mead, etc.
 [1800423]Enriched with cake and juice, etc.
 [1800424]Here, mixt with cake and water rest the Charu!
   World-makers, makers of the path, we worship those Gods of
    you who here partake oblations.
 [1800425]Let these which Gods have held for thee, these beakers covered
    o'er with cake,
   Be full of sacred food for thee, distilling fatness, rich in mead.
 [1800426]Grains which for thee I scatter, mixt with Sesamum, as holy
    food.
   May they for thee be excellent and potent. King Yama look on,
    them as thine with favour!
 [1800427]More immortality!
 [1800428]On all the earth, to heaven, the drop descended, on this place
    and on that which was before it.
   I offer up, throughout the seven oblations, the drop which still
    to one same place is moving.
 [1800429]Those who observe men look on wealth as Vayu with countless.
    streams, and as light-finding Arka;
   Those drain out Guerdon sprung from seven mothers, who satis-
    fy and evermore give presents.
 [1800430]They for their weal drain out the cask, the beaker four-holed,.
    the milch-cow Ida full of sweetness,
   Injure not, Agni, in the loftiest heaven Aditi heightening strength
    among the people.
 [1800431]On thee doth Savitar the God bestow this vesture for thy wear. [p. 204]
   Clothe thee herein, and find meet robe in Yama's realm to cover
    thee.
 [1800432]The grains of corn have now become a cow, the Sesamum her
    calf.
   He in the realm of Yama lives on her the inexhaustible.
 [1800433]Let these become thy milch-kine, man! supplying all thy heart's
    desires.
   There, speckled, white, like-hued and various-coloured, with
    calves of Sesamum let them stand beside thee.
 [1800434]Let the green grains become thy white, and speckled, The dusky
    corns become thy ruddy milch-kine.
   Let those with calves of Sesamum for ever yield strength to him
    and never flinch from milking.
 [1800435]I offer in Vaisvanara this oblation, thousandfold spring that
    pours a hundred steamlets.
   This with a swelling flow supports the Father, supports grand-
    fathers and their sires before them.
 [1800436]Beside the spring with hundred, thousand currents, expanding
    on the summit of the water,
   Exhaustless, yielding strength, never reluctant, the Fathers with
    their sacred food are seated.
 [1800437]This pile of wood, collected, heaped together, regard it, O ye,
    kinsmen, and come near it.
   To immortality this mortal goeth: prepare a home for him, all
    ye his kindred.
 [1800438]Be here, even here, acquiring wealth, here be thou thoughts here
    be thou strength.
   Be stronger here in manly power, life-giver, never beaten back.
 [1800439]Giving the son and grandson satisfaction, let these the present
   Waters full of sweetness,
   Pouring forth food and Amrit for the Fathers, refresh both these
    and those, the Goddess Waters.
 [1800440]40. Waters, send Agni forward to the Fathers: let them accept the
    sacrifice I offer.
   May they who follow Vigour that abideth there send us down
    wealth with full store of heroes.
 [1800441]Lover of butter, deathless, him, Oblation-bearer, they inflame.
   He knoweth well the treasured stores gone to the Fathers, far
    away. [p. 205]
 [1800442]The mingled draught, the mess of rice, the flesh which I present
    to thee,
   May these be full of food for thee, distilling fatness, rich in
    sweets.
 [1800443]Grains which for thee I scatter, mixt with Sesamum as sacred
    food,
   May these for thee be excellent and potent. King Yama look on,
    them, as thine, with favour.
 [1800444]This is the ancient, this the recent pathway, by which thy sires
    of olden time departed.
   They who first travelled it, and they who followed, convey thee
    to the world where dwell the righteous.
 [1800445]The pious call Sarasvati: they worship Sarasvati while sacrifice
    proceedeth.
   The righteous doers of good deeds invoke her: Sarasvati send
    bliss to him who giveth!
 [1800446]Approaching on the south our solemn worship, the Fathers call-
   Sarasvati to hear them.
   Sit on this holy grass and be ye joyful: give thou us strengthen-
    ing food that brings no sickness.
 [1800447]Sarasvati, who tamest with them, joying in hymns and food, O
   Goddess, with the Fathers,
   Here give the Sacrificer growth of riches, a portion, worth a
    thousand, of refreshment.
 [1800448]As Prithivi rests on earth, so do I seat thee. May the God Dhatar
    lengthen our existence.
   For you may he who parts in turn find treasures, but let the
   Dead among the Fathers.
 [1800449]Depart ye two: wipe ye away whatever omens of evil fortune
    here have told you.
   Go from this man, both Steers, to him who wills it: ye are my
    joys here by the giver's Fathers.
 [1800450]From a good quarter have we gained this guerdon, gift of this
    man, strength giving, plenteous milker.
   Bringing in youth old age unto the living, may she bear these
    together to the Fathers.
 [1800451]I bring this clipped grass hither for the Fathers: grass living,.
    higher, for the Gods I scatter.
   Mount this, O man, as victim: let the Fathers recognize thee:
    when thou hast travelled yonder. [p. 206]
 [1800452]Set on this grass thou hast become a victim. Fathers shall know
    thee yonder when they meet thee.
   Gather thy body, limb by limb, together: I by the power of
    prayer arrange thy members.
 [1800453]The royal Parna is the caldrons' cover: strength have we gained,
    force, power, and might, and vigour.
   Bestowing length of life upon the living, for long existence
    through a hundred autumns.
 [1800454]The share of vigour which gave this man being, the stone won
    lordship over foods that nourish.
   Hymn this with your oblations, Visvamitras: may he, may Yama,
    lengthen our existence.
 [1800455]As the Five Races of mankind for Yama set apart a house.
   Even so I set a house apart that greater numbers may be mine.
 [1800456]Take thou and wear this piece of gold, the gold thy father used
    to wear.
   Wipe tenderly the right hand of thy sire who goes away to
    heaven.
 [1800457]To all, the living and the dead, all that are born, the worshipful.
   Let the full brook of fatness run, o'erflowing, with stream of
    mead.
 [1800458]Far-seeing he flows on, the Bull, the Lord of hymns, promoter
    of the Sun, of Days, of Dawns, of Heaven.
   Breath of the rivers he hath roared into the jars, and through
    his wisdom entered into Indra's heart.
 [1800459]Let thy bright smoke envelop thee, spread forth, O Bright One,
    in the sky.
   For, Purifier, like the Sun thou shinest with thy radiant glow.
 [1800460]Indu is moving forth to Indra's destined place, and slights not
    as a friend the promise of his friend.
   Thou, Soma, comest nigh as bridegroom meets the bride, reach-
    ing the beaker by a course of hundred paths.
 [1800461]Well have they eaten and rejoiced: their dear ones have they
    shaken off.
   Sages, self-luminous, have praised: we who are youngest
    supplicate.
 [1800462]Come hither, Fathers, who deserve the Soma, by the deep path-
    ways which the Fathers travel.
   Bestow upon us life and store of children, and favour us with
    increase of our riches. [p. 207]
 [1800463]Depart, O Fathers, ye who merit Soma, by the deep pathways
    which the Fathers travel;
   But in a month, rich in fair sons and heroes, come back into
    our homes to eat oblation.
 [1800464]If Agni Jatavedas, as he bore you hence to the Fathers' world,
    hath left one single.
   Limb of your bodies, here do I restore it. Fathers, rejoice in
    heaven with all your members!
 [1800465]Meet for men's praises, Agni Jatavedas was sent as envoy when
    the day was closing.
   Thou gavest to the Fathers with oblation. They ate; eat, God,
    our offered sacrifices.
 [1800466]Here hast thou left thy heart; O man, as sisters leave their little
    pet. Do thou, O earth, envelop him.
 [1800467]Bright be to thee those worlds where dwell the Fathers! I seat
    thee in that sphere which they inhabit.
 [1800468]Thou art the grass whereon our Fathers seat them.
 [1800469]Loosen, O Varuna, the bond that binds us; loosen the bond
    above, between, and under.
   Then under thy protection, O Aditya, may we be sinless and
    restored to freedom.
 [1800470]From all those bonds, O Varuna, release us, wherewith a man
    is bound at length and cross-wise.
   Then may we live a hundred autumn seasons guarded by thee,
   O King, by thee protected.
 [1800471]To Agni, bearer of oblation to the Manes, be Hail! and
    homage!
 [1800472]To Soma connected with the Fathers Hail! and homage!
 [1800473]To the Fathers connected with Soma Hail! and homage!
 [1800474]To Yama connected with the Fathers Hail! and homage!
 [1800475]To thee, O Great-grandfather, and those with thee be this cry of
   Hail
 [1800476]To thee, Great-grandfather, and to those with thee be this cry of
   Hail!
 [1800477]To thee, O Fathers, be this cry of Hail!
 [1800478]Hail to the Fathers who inhabit earth!
 [1800479]Hail to the Fathers who inhabit the firmament!
 [1800480]Hail to the Fathers who dwell in heaven!
 [1800481]Hail, Fathers, to your energy! Hail, Fathers, to your sap!
 [1800482]Hail Father; to your wrath! Hail, Fathers, to your ardour! [p. 208]
 [1800483]Hail, Fathers, to what is awful! Hail to what is terrible in you!'

HYMN VI

  

The purusha-Sukta, on the mystical Sacrifice of Purusha

[1900601]Purusha hath a thousand arms, a thousand eyes, a thousand feet.
   On every side pervading earth he fills a space ten fingers wide.
 [1900602]He with three quarters rose to heaven here reappeared a fourth
    of him.
   Thence he strode forth on every side to all that eats not and that
    eats.
 [1900603]So mighty is his grandeur, yea, greater than this is Purusha.
   All creatures are one-fourth of him, three-fourths what dieth
    not in heaven. [p. 214]
 [1900604]Purusha is in truth this All, what hath been and what yet shall;
    be
   Lord, too, of immortality--and what hath grown with some-
    what else.
 [1900605]When they divided Purusha how many portions did they make?
   What was his mouth? what were his arms? what are the names
    of thighs and feet?
 [1900606]The Brahman was his mouth, of both his arms was the Rajanya
    made.
   His waist became the Vaisya, from his feet the Sudra was
    produced.
 [1900607]The Moon was gendered from his mind, and from his eye the
   Sun had birth.
   Indra and Agni from his mouth were born and Vayu from his
    breath.
 [1900608]Forth from his navel come mid-air; the sky was fashioned from
    his head.
   Earth from his feet, and from his ear the regions. Thus they
    formed the worlds.
 [1900609]In the beginning rose Viraj: Purusha from Viraj was born.
   As soon as he was born he spread westward and eastward o'er
    the earth.
 [1900610]When Gods performed the sacrifice with Purusha as their
    offering.
   Spring was the butter, summer was the fuel, autumn was the
    gift.
 [1900611]That sacrifice, first-born Purusha, they hallowed with the sprink-
    led Rains.
   The Deities, the Sadhyas, all the Vasus sacrificed with him.
 [1900612]From it were horses born, from it all creatures with two rows of
    teeth.
   From it were generated kine, from it were goats and sheep
    produced.
 [1900613]From that great general sacrifice Richas and Sama hymns were
    born;
   Therefrom the metres were produced: the Yajus had its birth
    from it.
 [1900614]From that great general sacrifice the dripping fat was gathered up:
   It formed the creatures fleet as wind, and animals both wild and
    tame. [p. 215]
 [1900615]Seven fencing-logs had he, thrice seven layers of fuel were
    prepared.
   When, offering sacrifice, the Gods bound as their victim Purusha.
 [1900616]Forth from head of the high God seven-and-seventy bright
    beams.
   Sprang into being, of the King Soma produced from Purusha.

    tains, in the heavenly regions.
 [1900802]Propitious, mighty, let the eight-and-twenty together deal me
    out my share of profit.
   Profit and wealth be mine, and wealth and profit! To Day and
   Night be adoration rendered!
 [1900803]Fair be my sunset, fair my morn and evening and day with.
    lucky chase and happy omens;
   With blessing and success, immortal Agni, go to the mortal and.
    return rejoicing.
 [1900804]Excitement and invoking cry, ill-omened sneezing and reproof,
   All sounds of empty pitchers send into the distance, Savitar!
 [1900805]May we escape an evil sneeze, enjoy the sneeze of happy luck,
   And may our nostrils smelling what is pleasant pour forth
    fragrant scent.
 [1900806]These flames of Brahmanaspati borne to all quarters in the-
    wind,
   Turn them all hither, Indra, and make them most gracious unto,
    me.

    drous, mighty, and successful
   First, when the need hath come will I employ them by which
    the heaven of Asuras was conquered.
 [1901302]Swift, like a dread bull sharpening his weapons, rapidly striking,
    stirring up the people,
   Loud shouting, vigilant, the one sole Hero, Indra subdued a
    hundred hosts together.
 [1901303]With him loud-roaring, ever watchful, victor bold, hard to over-
    throw, whom none may vanquish,
   Indra the strong whose hand bears arrows, conquer, ye heroes
    now, now vanquish in the combat.
 [1901304]He rules with those who carry shafts and quivers, Indra who
    with his hand brings hosts together,
   Foe-conquering, strong of arm, the Soma-drinker,
    with mighty bow, shooting with well-laid arrows.
 [1901305]Conspicuous by thy strength, firm, foremost fighter, mighty and
    fierce, victorious, all-subduing,
   O'ercoming might, excelling men and heroes, mount the kine-
    winning conquering car, O Indra.
 [1901306]Troop-vanquisher, kine-winner, armed with thunder, who quells
    an army and with might destroys it,
   Follow him, comrades! quit yourselves like heroes, and like this
   Indra show your zeal and courage.
 [1901307]Piercing the cow-stalls with surpassing vigour, Indra the pitiless
    hero, wild with anger, [p. 224]
   Victor in fight, unshaken and resistless,--may he protect our
    armies in our battles.
 [1901308]Brihaspati, fly with thy chariot hither, slayer of demons, driving.
    off our foemen.
   Be thou protector of our bodies, crushing our enemies, destroy-
    ing those who hate us.
 [1901309]Indra guide these! Brihaspati, the Guerdon, and Soma, and the
   Sacrifice precede them!
   And let the banded Maruts march in forefront of heavenly hosts
    that conquer and demolish.
 [1901310]Ours be the potent host of mighty Indra, King Varuna, and
   Maruts and Adityas.
   Uplifted is the shout of Gods who conquer, high-minded God
    who cause the world to tremble.
 [1901311]May Indra aid us when our flags are gathered: victorious be th
    arrows of our army.
   May our brave men of war prevail in battle. Ye Gods, protect u
    in the shouts of onset.

    greater might.
 [1903406]Three times the Gods engendered thee fixt on the surface of the
    earth;
   The Brahmans of the olden time knew that thy name was
   Angiras;
 [1903407]The ancient plants surpass thee not, nor any herbs of recent
    days.
   A potent charm is Jangida, a most felicitous defence.
 [1903408]Then when thou sprangest into life, Jangida of un-measured
    strength,
   Indra, O mighty One, bestowed great power upon thee from the
    first. [p. 240]
 [1903409]To thee in truth, O Forest Tree, Indra the mighty One gave
    strength.
   Driving away all maladies, strike thou the demons down, O
   Plant.
 [1903410]Lumbago and rheumatic pain, consumptive cough, and pleurisy,
   And fever which each Autumn brings, may Jangida make-

A similar charm addressed to the same

[1903501]While their lips uttered Indra's name the Rishis gave us Jangida..
   Which in the earliest time Gods made a remedy, Vishkandha's-
    cure.
 [1903502]So may this Jangida guard us, even as a treasurer guards wealth,.
   Even this which Gods and Brahmans made a malice-quelling sure
    defence.
 [1903503]Hard-hearted men, the cruel eye, the sinner who hath come to-
    us,
   Destroy thou these with watchful care, O thou who hast a.
    thousand eyes. Thou, Jangida, art my defence.
 [1903504]Guard me from earth and guard me from the heavens, guard
    me from middle air, from plants protect me.
   Protect me from the present and the future. From every region
   Jangida preserve us!
 [1903505]All sorcerers made by the Gods, all that arise from mortal men,.
   These, one and all, let Jangida, healer of all, make impotent.

[1903601]The Hundred-haired hath banished hence fiends and Consump-

   With splendour hath the charm that scares demons of ill-name
    mounted up.
 [1903602]It drives off demons with its horns and sorceresses with its root,
   It stays Consumption with its waist: from this no wickedness
    escapes.
 [1903603]Consumptions, light and serious, and those which sounds
    accompany,
   All these the Amulet, Hundred-haired, scarer of fiends, hath
    banished hence.
 [1903604]A hundred men hath it produced, hundred Consumptions chased
    away,
   All fiends of evil-name it hath smitten, and shakes the
   Rakshasas.
 [1903605]The Bull that weareth horns of gold, this Amulet with hundred
    hairs,
   Hath cleft the demons of ill-name and overcome the Rakshasas.

A hymn to Night for protection from fiends, robbers, snakes and wolves

[1904701]Night! the terrestrial realm hath been filled with the Father's
    power and might.
   Thou spreadest forth on high unto the seats of Heaven: dark-
    ness that strikes with awe comes near.
 [1904702]Each moving thing finds rest in her whose yonder boundary is
    not seen, nor that which keeps her separate.
   O spacious, darksome Night, may we uninjured reach the end of
    thee, reach, O thou blessed One, thine end.
 [1904703]Thy ninety-nine examiners, O Night, who look upon mankind,
   Eighty-and-eight in number, or seven-and-seventy are they.
 [1904704]Sixty-and-six, O opulent, fifty-and-five, O happy One,
   Forty-and-four and thirty-three are they, O thou enriched with
    spoil.
 [1904705]Twenty-and-two hast thou, O Night, eleven, yea, and fewer still.
   With these protectors guard us well. O Daughter of the Sky, to-
    day.
 [1904706]Let not a fiends or spiteful man, let no ill-wisher master us.
   Let not the robber seize our cows, nor the wolf take our sheep
    today.
 [1904707]Let not the thief, O Blessed, seize our horses, nor she-fiends our
    men.
   Let thief and robber run away on pathways most remote from
    us.
 [1904708]Far from us let Rope with Fangs, far from us let the wicked
    flee.
   Do thou make blind and headless. Night, the serpent with his
    pungent breath.
 [1904709]Crush the wolf's jaws in pieces, strike the robber dead against a
    post. [p. 250]
   In thee, O Night, do we abide: we here will sleep. Be watchful
    thou.
 [1904710]Give thou protection to our kine; and to our horses, and our
    men.

 [1904802]Entrust thou us to Dawn, O Mother Night.
   May Dawn entrust us to the Day, and Day to thee, O splendid.
   One.
 [1904803]Whatever flying thing be here, whatever thing that creeps and.
    crawls.
   Whatever fastens on a joint, therefrom do thou protect us,
   Night.
 [1904804]So guard thou us from west and east, protect us from the north
    and south.
   O splendid One, preserve us: we, the singers of thy praise, are
    here.
 [1904805]They who are followers of Night, and they who watch o'er
    living things.
   They who protect all cattle, they keep watch and ward over our
    lives, over our herds keep watch and ward.
 [1904806]Verily, Night, I know thy name, Dropper of Fatness art thou
    called.
   Thee Bharadvaja knew as such: as such be watchful o'er our
    wealth.

HYMN XLIX

  

A hymn of Praise and prayer to Night

[1904901]Friend of the home, the strong and youthful maiden, Night, dear
    to Savitar the God, and Bhaga,
   All-compassing, all-glorious, prompt to listen, hath with her
    greatness filled the earth and heaven.
 [1904902]Over all depths hath she gone up, and mounted, most mighty
   One, the sky's exalted summit.
   Over me now the loving Night is spreading with her auspicious.
   Godlike ways like Mitra.
 [1904903]Excellent, high-born, blissful, meet for worship, Night, thou hast
    come: stay here with friendly spirit.
   Guard us, the food for men that we have gotten, and all pro-
    sperity that comes of cattle.
 [1904904]With eager haste hath Night assumed the vigour of leopard,.
    tiger, or of tawny lion,
   The horse's neighing and the wild-man's bellow, Thou takest
    many a form when thou appearest.
 [1904905]Kind through the Night be absence of the sunshine: Mother of
   Frost, may she be swift to hear us.
   Take notice of the hymn, thou highly favoured, wherewith I
    worship thee in all the regions.
 [1904906]Even as a King, O splendid Night, thou takest pleasure in our
    hymn.
   May we through Mornings as they flush have all our good men,
    round us, and become possessors of all wealth.
 [1904907]Yes, Ramya is the name thou hast assumed. The men who fain.
    would spoil.
   My wealth do thou annoy, O Night, that not one robber may
    appear, none may a second time appear.
 [1904908]Thou like a well-wrought cup, O Night, art lovely: thou, a.
    young maid, art formed in perfect beauty.
   Thou lovingly, for me with eyes to se: them, hast bound on thee
    heaven's stars as thine adornment. [p. 252]
 [1904909]Whatever robber comes to-day, mischievous mortal enemy.
   Let Night go forth, encounter him, and smite away his neck and
    head;
 [1904910]His feet that he may walk no more, his hands that he may do
    no harm.
   The robber who comes hitherward goes crushed and mutilated
    hence,
   Goes hence, goes far away from us, goes hence and bears no
    spoil away.

[1905001]Blind him and make him headless, Night! the serpent with the

   Strike from his head the wolf's two eyes, and dash the thief
    against a post.
 [1905002]Those oxen that are thine, O Night, with sharpened horns and
    rapid pace,
   With those transport us safe to-day o'er difficulties everywhere.
 [1905003]Uninjured in our bodies may we pass through each succeeding
    night,
   And let malignities fail to pass, as men without a boat the depth.
 [1905004]As millet hurried through the air before us is beheld no more.
   So cause the man to vanish, Night, who plans to do us injury.
 [1905005]The thief hast thou kept far away, the robber driver of our kine.
   Even him who having covered up the horse's head would lead
    him off.
 [1905006]If dealing treasure thou hast come to-day, O highly favoured
   Night.
   Cause thou us to enjoy it all so that this may not pass away. [p. 253]
 [1905007]Do thou entrust us to the Dawn, all of us free from sin, O
   Night.
   May Dawn deliver us to Day, and Day to thee, O glorious One.

A hymn to Kama or Time

[1905301]Prolific, thousand-eyed, and undecaying, a horse with seven
    reins Time bears us onward.
   Sages inspired with holy knowledge mount him: his chariot
    wheels are all the worlds of creatures.
 [1905302]This Time hath seven rolling wheels and seven naves immorality
    is the chariot's axle.
   This Time brings hitherward all worlds about us: as primal
   Deity is he entreated.
 [1905303]On Time is laid an overflowing beaker: this we behold in many
    a place appearing.
   He carries from us all these worlds of creatures. They call him
   Kala in the loftiest heaven.
 [1905304]He only made the worlds of life, he only gathered the worlds
    of living things together.
   Their son did he become who was their Father: no other higher
    power than he existeth.
 [1905305]Kala created yonder heaven, and Kala made these realms of
    earth.
   By Kala, stirred to motion, both what is and what shall be
    expand.
 [1905306]Kala created land; the Sun in Kala hath his light and heat.
   In Kala rest all things that be: in Kala doth the eye discern.

   These living creatures, one and all, rejoice when Kala hath

   Yea, Kala, who was father of Prajapati, is Lord of All.

   Supreme is supplicated.

[1905601]Thou art come hither from the world of Yama: thou, resolute,

   Thou, Sleep, created in the Asura's dwelling, goest, well-know-
    ing, with the solitary.
 [1905602]At first the all-containing, depth beheld thee, ere Night was
    born, when only Day existed.
   Thence hast thou come, thence, Sleep, hast thou come hither,
    concealing, deep within, all form and figure.
 [1905603]Come from the Asuras in lofty, glory, he hath approached the
   Gods in search of greatness.
   Winners of heavenly light, the Three-and-Thirty endowed this
   Sleep with his supreme dominion.
 [1905604]Of him nor Fathers nor the Gods have knowledge, the Gods
    whose gentle talk is still about him.
   Urged by command of Varuna the Adityas, Heroes, transported
   Sleep to Trita Aptya.
 [1905605]Thou whose severity hath reached ill-doers, and whose reward
    the good have gained in slumber,
   Delightest heaven with thy most lofty kinship, born from his
    spirit who was worn and weary.
 [1905606]Of old we know all places whence thou comest. O Sleep, we
    know him who is here thy ruler.
   Protect us here illustrious with glory. Go, from afar, with
    poisons, into distance.

   So to the foeman we transfer together all the evil dream.
 [1905702]Princes came together, debts came together, Kushthas came to-
    gether,
   Sixteenths came together. The whole evil dream that hath visited
    us we send away as a bad dream to the man who hates us.
 [1905703]Child of Gods' Consorts, minister of Yama is the good Dream:
    that which is my trouble we drive away to the enemy.
 [1905704]Thou whose name is Rough art the mouth of the Black Bird.
   As such we know thee, Dream, as such we know thee well. Like
    a horse art thou, O Dream. As they bind girth and surcingle
    on a horse, so bind the alien mischief-maker, the scorner of
    the Gods.
 [1905705]The evil dream that threatens us, threatens our cattle or our
    home.
   That let the scorner of the Gods, the alien mischief-maker bind
    as a gold jewel round his neck.
 [1905706]Having measured off nine cubits' distance from us we give away
    the whole of the evil dream to the man who hates us.

    nothing of our life and vigour.
 [1905802]Let lively breath invite us: we call vital breath to visit us.
   Earth and air's middle realm have gathered, Soma, Brihaspati
    and Dhartar gathered vigour.
 [1905803]The earth and heaven have come to be two gatherers up of vigo-
    rous might.
   So let us gather vigour up and closely follow after Earth.
   With glory come the cows and stand beside the master of the
    herd. Let us when we have gathered fame and glory closely
    follow Earth.
 [1905804]Prepare the cow-stall, for there drink your heroes: stitch ye the
    coats of armour wide and many.
   Make iron forts defying all assailants: let not your pitcher leak;

 [1905805]The eye of sacrifice, source and beginning with voice, car, spirit
    unto him I offer.
   To this our sacrifice, wrought by Visvakarman, may the Gods
    come gracious and kindly-hearted.

    revel in the food we bring them.

    the Gods by might and battle.
   Wise singers glorify with chanted praises these his achievements
    in Vivasvan's dwelling.
 [2001108]Excellent, conqueror, the victory-giver, the winner of the light
    and godlike waters,
   He who hath won this broad earth and this heaven,--in Indra
    they rejoice who love devotions.
 [2001109]He gained possession of the Sun and horses; Indra obtained
    the cow who feedeth many.
   Treasure of gold he won; he smote the Dasyus and gave protec-
    tion to the race of Aryas.
 [2001110]He took the plants and days for his possession; he gained the
    forest trees and air's mid-region.
   Vala he cleft, and chased away opponents: thus was he tamer
    of the overweening.
 [2001111]Call we on Maghavan, auspicious Indra, best Hero in the fight
    where spoil is gathered,
   The Strong, who listens, who gives aid in battles, who slays the
   Vritras, wins and gathers treasures.

HYMN XII

[2001201]Prayers have been offered up through love of glory: Vasishtha,
    honour Indra in the battle.
   He who with might extends through all existence hears words
    which I, his faithful servant, utter.
 [2001202]A cry was raised which reached the Gods, O Indra, a cry to
    them to send us strength in combat.
   None among men knows his own life's duration: bear us in
    safety over these our troubles.
 [2001203]The Bays, the booty-seeking car I harness: my prayers have
    reached him who accepts them gladly.
   Indra, when he had slain resistless Vritras, forced with his might
    the two world-halves asunder.
 [2001204]Like barren cows, moreover, swelled the waters: the singers
    sought thy holy rite, O Indra.
   Come unto us as with his team comes Vayu: thou, through our
    solemn hymns, bestowest booty.
 [2001205]So may these gladdening draughts rejoice thee, Indra, the Mighty,
    very bounteous to the singer.
   Alone among the Gods thou pitiest mortals: O Hero, make thee
    glad at this libation.
 [2001206]Thus the Vasishthas glorify with praises Indra, the Mighty One,
    whose arm wields thunder.
   Praised, may he guard our wealth in kine and heroes. Ye Gods,.
    preserve us evermore with blessings.
 [2001207]Impetuous, Thunderer, strong, quelling the mighty, King, potent,
   Vritra-slayer, Soma-drinker,
   May he come hither with his yoked bay horses. May Indra glad-
    den him at noon libation.

HYMN XIII

[2001301]Lords of great wealth, Brihaspati and Indra, rejoicing at this
    sacrifice drink Soma.
   Let the abundant drops sink deep within you: vouchsafe us
    riches with full store of heroes.
 [2001302]Let your swift-gliding coursers bear you hitherward with their
    fleet pinions. Come ye forward with your arms.
   Sit on the grass; a wide seat hath been made for you: delight
    yourselves, O Maruts, in the pleasant food.
 [2001303]For Jatavedas, worthy of our praise, will we frame with our
    mind this eulogy as 'twere a car.
   For good in his assembly is this care of ours. Let us not in thy
    friendship, Agni, suffer harm.
 [2001304]With these, borne on one car, Agni, approach us; or borne on
    many, for thy steeds are able.
   Bring, with their Dames, the Gods, the Three-and-Thirty, after
    thy Godlike nature, and he joyful.

[2001401]We call on thee, O peerless One. We, seeking help, possessing
    nothing firm ourselves,
   Call on thee wonderful in fight.
 [2001402]On thee for aid in sacrifice. This youth of ours, the bold, the
    mighty, hath gone forth.
   We, therefore, we thy friends, Indra, have chosen thee, free-
    giver, as our guardian God.
 [2001403]Him who of old hath brought to us this and that blessing, him
   I magnify for you,
   Even Indra, O my friends, for help:
 [2001404]Borne by bay steeds, the Lord of heroes, ruling men, for it is he
    who takes delight. [p. 274]

HYMN XV

[2001501]To him most liberal, lofty Lord of lofty wealth, verily powerful
    and strong, I bring my hymn,
   Whose checkless bounty, as of waters down a slope, is spread
    abroad for all that live, to give them strength.
 [2001502]Now all this world, for worship, shall come after thee--the
    offerer's libations like descending floods,
   When the well-loved one seems to rest upon the hill, the thun-
    derbolt of Indra, shatterer wrought of gold.
 [2001503]To him the terrible, most worthy of high praise, like radiant
   Dawn, bring gifts with reverence in this rite,
   Whose being, for renown, yea, Indra-power and light, have been
    created, like bay steeds, to move with speed.
 [2001504]Thine, Indra, praised by many excellently rich! are we who
    trusting in thy help draw near to thee.
   Lover of praise, none else but thou receives our laud: as Earth
    loves all her creatures, love thou this our hymn.
 [2001505]Great is thy power, O Indra, we are thine. Fulfil, O Maghavan,
    the wish of this thy worshipper.
   After thee lofty heaven hath measured out its strength to thee
    and to thy power this earth hath bowed itself.
 [2001506]Thou, who hast thunder for thy weapon, with thy bolt hast
    shattered into pieces this broad massive cloud.
   Thou hast sent down obstructed floods that they may flow: thou
    hast, thine own for ever, all victorious might.

HYMN XVI

[2001601]Like birds who keep their watch, plashing in water, like the loud
    voices of the thundering rain-cloud,
   Like merry streamlets bursting from the mountain thus to
   Brihaspati our hymns have sounded.
 [2001602]The son of Angiras, meeting the cattle, as Bhaga, brought in
   Aryaman among us.
   As Friend of men he decks the wife and husband. As for the
    race, Brihaspati, nerve our coursers.
 [2001603]Brihaspati, having won them from the mountains, strewed down,
    like barley out of winnowing-baskets,
   The vigorous, wandering cows who aid the pious, desired of all,
    of blameless form, well-coloured.
 [2001604]As the Sun dews with meath the seat of Order, and casts a flam-
    ing meteor down from heaven,
   So from the rock Brihaspati forced the cattle, and cleft the
    earth's skin as it were with water.
 [2001605]Forth from mid-air with light he draye the darkness, as the gale
    blows a lily from the river.
   Like the wind grasping at the cloud of Vala, Brihaspati gathered
    to himself the cattle.
 [2001606]Brihaspati, when he with fiery lightnings cleft through the
    weapon of reviling Vala,
   Consumed him as tongues eat what teeth have compassed: he
    threw the prisons of the red cows open.
 [2001607]That secret name borne by the lowing cattle within the cave
   Brihaspati discovered,
   And draye, himself, the bright kine from the mountain, like a
    bird's young after the eggs' disclosure.
 [2001608]He looked around on rock-imprisoned sweetness as one who
    eyes a fish in scanty water.
   Brihaspati, cleaving through with varied clamour, brought it
    forth like a bowl from out the timber. [p. 276]
 [2001609]He found the light of heaven, and fire, and Morning: with lucid
    rays he forced apart the darkness.
   As from a joint, Brihaspati took the marrow of Vala as he
    gloried in his cattle.
 [2001610]As trees for foliage robbed by winter, Vala mourned for the
    cows Brihaspati had taken.
   He did a deed ne'er done, ne'er to be equalled, whereby the sun
    and moon ascend alternate.
 [2001611]Like a dark steed adorned with pearl, the Fathers have decorat-
    ed heaven with constellations.
   They set the light in day, in night the darkness, Brihaspati cleft
    the rock and found the cattle.
 [2001612]This homage have we offered to the Cloud-God who thunders
    out to many in succession.
   May this Brihaspati vouchsafe us fulness of life with kine and
    horses, men, and heroes.

HYMN XVII

  I. In perfect unison all yearning hymns of mine that find the light
    of heaven have sung forth Indra's praise.
   As wives embrace their lord, the comely bridegroom, so they
    compass Maghavan about that he may help.
 [2001702]Directed unto thee my spirit never strays, for I have set my
    hopes on thee, O much-invoked!
   Sit, wonderful! as King upon the sacred grass, and let thy
    drinking-place be by the Soma juice.
 [2001703]From indigence and hunger Indra turns away: Maghavan hath
    dominion over precious wealth.
   These the Seven Rivers flowing on their downward path increase
    the vital vigour of the Mighty Steer.
 [2001704]As on the fair-leafed tree rest birds, to Indra flow the gladden-
    ing Soma juices that the bowls contain.
   Their face that glows with splendour through their mighty
    power hath found the shine of heaven for man, the Aryas'
    light.
 [2001705]As in the game a gambler piles his winnings, so Maghavan,
    sweeping all together, gained the Sun.
   This mighty deed of thine none other could achieve, none,
   Maghavan, before thee, none in recent time.
 [2001706]Maghavan came by turns to all the tribes of men: the Steer
    took notice of the people's songs of praise.
   The man in whose libations Sakra hath delight by means of
    potent Somas vanquisheth his foes.
 [2001707]As waters flow together to the river, thus Somas to Indra flow,
    as rivulets to the lake.
   In place of sacrifice sages exalt his might, as the rain swells the
    corn by moisture sent from heaven.
 [2001708]He rushes through the region like a furious bull, he who hath
    made these floods the dames of worthy lords.
   This Maghavan hath found light for the man who brings
    oblation, sheds the juice, and promptly pours his gifts.
 [2001709]Let the keen axe come forth together with the light: here be,
    as erst, the teeming cow of sacrifice.
   Let the Red God shine pure with his refulgent ray, and let the
   Lord of heroes glow like heaven's clear sheen. [p. 278]
 [2001710]O much-invoked, may we subdue all famine and evil want with
    store of grain and cattle.
   May we allied, as first in rank, with princes, obtain possessions
    by our own exertion.
 [2001711]Brihaspati protect us from the rearward, and from above, and
    from below, from sinners.
   May Indra from the front, and from the centre, as friend to
    friends, vouchsafe us room and freedom.
 [2001712]Ye twain are Lords of wealth in earth and heaven, thou, O
   Brihaspati, and thou, O Indra.
   Mean though he be, give wealth to him who lauds you. Preserve
    us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.

   The Kanvas praise thee with their hymns.
 [2001802]Naught else, O Thunderer, have I praised in the skilled singer's
    eulogy:
   On thy laud only have I thought.
 [2001803]The Gods seek him who presses out the Soma; they desire not
    sleep:
   Incessantly they punish sloth.
 [2001804]Faithful to thee we loudly sing, heroic Indra, songs to thee.
   Mark, gracious Lord, this act of ours.
 [2001805]Give us not up to man's reproach, to foeman's hateful calumny:
   In thee alone is all my strength.
 [2001806]Thou art mine ample coat of mail, my champion, Vritra-slayes,
    thou.
   With thee for Friend I brave the foe.

    hitherward.
   Direct thy spirit and thine eye.
 [2001903]O Indra, Lord of Hundred Powers, with all our songs we
    invocate.
   Thy names for triumph over foes.
 [2001904]We strive for glory through the powers immense of him whom
    many praise,
   Of Indra who supports mankind.
 [2001905]For the foe's slaughter I address Indra whom many invocate,
   To win us booty in the wars.
 [2001906]In battles be victorious. We seek thee, Lord of Hundred Powers,
   O Indra, that the foe may fall.
 [2001907]In splendid combats of the hosts, in glories where the fight is
    won,
   Indra, be victor over foes.

 [2002002]O Satakratu, powers which thou mid the Five Races hast dis-
    played
   These, Indra, do I claim of thee.
 [2002003]Indra, great glory hast thou gained. Win splendid fame which
    none may mar:
   We make thy might perpetual.
 [2002004]Come to us either from anear, or, Sakra, come from far away. [p. 280]
   Indra, wherever be thy home, come to us thence, O Thunder-
    armed.
 [2002005]Verily Indra, conquering all, driveth even mighty fear away;
   For firm is he and swift to act.
 [2002006]Indra be gracious unto us: sin shall not reach us afterward .
   And good shall be before us still,
 [2002007]From all the regions of the world let Indra send security.
   The foe-subduer, swift to act.

HYMN XXI

[2002101]We will present fair praise unto the Mighty One, our hymns to
   Indra in Vivasvan's dwelling-place;
   For he hath ne'er found wealth in those who seem to sleep;
    those who give wealth to men accept no paltry praise.
 [2002102]Giver of horses, Indra, giver, thou, of kine, giver of barley,
    thou art Lord and guard of wealth:
   Man's helper from of old, not disappointing hope, Friend of
    our friends, to thee as such we sing this praise.
 [2002103]Indra, most splendid, powerful, rich in mighty deeds, this
    treasure spread around is known to be thine own.
   Gather therefrom. O Conqueror, and bring to us: fail not the
    hope of him who loves and sings to thee.
 [2002104]Well-pleased with these bright flames and with these Soma
    drops, take thou away our poverty with steeds and kine.
   With Indra scattering the Dasyu through these drops, freed
    from their hate may we obtain abundant food.
 [2002105]Let us obtain, O Indra, plenteous wealth and food, with strength
    exceeding glorious, shining to the sky.
   May we obtain the Goddess Providence, the strength of heroes,
    special source of cattle, rich in steeds.
 [2002106]These our libations, strength inspiring Soma draughts, gladdened
    thee in the fight with Vritra, Hero-Lord, [p. 281]
   What time thou slewest for the singer with trimmed grass ten
    thousand Vritras, thou resistless in thy might.
 [2002107]Thou goest on from fight to fight intrepidly, destroying castle
    after castle here with strength;
   Thou Indra, with thy friend who makes the foe bow down,
    slewest from far away the guileful Namuchi.
 [2002108]Thou hast stuck down in death Karanja, Parnaya, in Atithigva's
    very glorious going forth:
   Unyielding, when Rijisvan compassed them with siege, thou hast
    destroyed the hundred towns of Vangrida.
 [2002109]With all-outstripping chariot wheel, O Indra, thou far-famed,
    hast overthrown the twice ten kings of men,
   With sixty thousand nine-and-ninety followers, who came in
    arms to fight with friendless Susravas.
 [2002110]Thou hast protected Susravas with succour, and Turvayana with
    thine aid, O Indra:
   Thou madest Kutsa, Atithigva, Ayu subject unto this king, the
    young, the mighty.
 [2002111]May we protected by the Gods hereafter remain thy very pro-
    sperous friends, O Indra.
   Thee we extol, enjoying through thy favour life-long and joyful
    and with store of heroes.

HYMN XXV

[2002501]Indra, the mortal man well guarded by thine aid goes foremost
    in the wealth of horses and of kine.
   With amplest wealth thou fillest him, as round about the waters
    clearly seen afar fill Sindhu full.
 [2002502]The heavenly waters come not nigh the priestly bowl: they but
    look down and see how far mid-air is spread:
   The Deities conduct the pious man to them: like suitors they
    delight in him who loveth prayer.
 [2002503]Praiseworthy blessing hast thou laid upon the pair who with
    uplifted ladle serve thee, man and wife.
   Unchecked he dwells and prospers in thy law: thy power brings
    blessing to the sacrificer pouring gifts.
 [2002504]First the Angirases won themselves vital power, whose fires were
    kindled through good deeds and sacrifice.
   The men together found the Pani's hoarded wealth, the cattle,
    and the wealth in horses and in kine,
 [2002505]Atharvan first by sacrifices laid the path; then, guardian of the
   Law, sprang up the loving Sun.
   Usana Kavya drove the kine hither with him: let us with offer-
    ings honour Yama's deathless birth.
 [2002506]When sacred grass is trimmed to aid the auspicious work, or
    the hymn makes its voice of praise sound to the sky,
   Where the stone rings as 'twere a singer skilled in laud,--Indra
    in truth delights when these come near to him.
 [2002507]To make thee start, a strong true draught I offer to thee the
   Bull, O thou whom bay steeds carry.
   Here take delight. O Indra, in our voices while thou art hymned
    with power and all our spirit.

    kinds,
   And all that strengthens, to our call.

 [2002604]They who stand round him as he moves harness the bright, the
    ruddy steed:
   The lights are shining in the sky.
 [2002605]On both sides of the car they yoke the two bay coursers dear to
    him,

    sage,
   Were I the lord of herds of kine,
 [2002703]To worshippers who press the juice thy goodness, Indra, is a
    cow.
   Yielding in plenty kine and steeds.
 [2002704]None is there, Indra, God or man, to hinder thy munificence,
   The wealth which, lauded, thou wilt give.
 [2002705]The sacrifice made Indra strong when he unrolled the earth and
    made
   Himself a diaden in heaven.
 [2002706]Thine aid we claim, O Indra, thine who after thou hast waxen
    great.
   Hast won all treasures for thine own.

HYMN XXVIII

[2002801]In Soma's ecstasy Indra spread the firmament and realms of
    light.
   When he cleft Vala limb from limb.
 [2002802]Showing the hidden he draye forth the cows for the Angirases,
   And Vala he cast headlong down.
 [2002803]By Indra were the luminous realms of heaven established and
    secured.
   Firm and immovable in their place.
 [2002804]Indra, thy laud moves quickly like a joyous wave of water-floods.
   Bright shine the drops that gladden thee.

HYMN XXIX

  I. For thou, O Indra, art the God whom hymns and praises
    magnify:
   Thou blessest those who worship thee.
 [2002902]Bay horses with their long manes bring Indra to drink the
   Soma juice,
   The Bountiful to our sacrifice.
 [2002903]With waters' foam thou torest off, Indra, the head of Namuchi,
   Subduing all contending hosts.
 [2002904]The Dasyus, when they fain would climb by magic arts and
    mount to heaven,
   Thou, Indra, castest down to earth.
 [2002905]As Soma-drinker conquering all, thou scatteredst to every side
   Their band who poured no gifts to thee.

HYMN XXX

[2003001]In the great synod will I laud thy two bay steeds: I prize the
    sweet strong drink of thee the Warrior-God,
   His who pours lovely oil as'twere with yellow drops. Let my
    songs enter thee whose form hath golden tints.
 [2003002]Ye who--in concert sing unto the gold-hued place, like bay steeds
    driving onward to the heavenly seat,
   For Indra laud ye strength allied with tawny steeds, laud him
    whom cows content as'twere with yellow drops.
 [2003003]His is that thunderbolt, of iron, golden-hued, gold-coloured,
    very dear, and yellow in his arms;
   Bright with strong teeth, destroying with its tawny rage. In
   Indra are set fast all forms of golden hue.
 [2003004]As if a lovely ray were laid upon the sky, the golden thunder-
    bolt spread out as in a race.
   That iron bolt with yellow jaw smote Ahi down. A thousand
    flames had he who bore the tawny-hued. [p. 288]
 [2003005]Thou, thou, when praised by men who sacrificed of old, hadst
    pleasure in their lauds, O Indra golden-haired.
   All that befits thy song of praise thou welcomest, the perfect:
    pleasant gift, O golden-hued from birth.

HYMN XXXI

[2003101]These two dear Bays bring hither Indra on his car, thunder-
    armed, joyous, meet for laud, to drink his fill.
   Many libations flow for him who loveth them: to Indra have:
    the gold-hued Soma juices run.
 [2003102]The gold-hued drops have flowed to gratify his wish: the yellow.
    drops have urged the swift Bays to the Strong.
   He who speeds on with bay steeds even as he lists hath satisfied
    his longing for the golden drops.
 [2003103]At the swift draught the Soma-drinker waxed in might, the iron.
   One with yellow beard and golden hair,
   He, Lord of tawny coursers. Lord of fleet-foot mares, will bear
    his bay steeds safely over all distress.
 [2003104]His yellow-coloured jaws, like ladles, move apart, what time,.
    for strength, he makes the yellow-tinted stir,
   When. while the bowl stands there, he grooms his tawny steeds,
    when he hath drunk strong drink, the sweet juice that he:
    loves.
 [2003105]Yea, to the dear one's seat in homes of heaven and earth the-
    bay steeds' Lord hath whinnied like a horse for food.
   Then the great wish hath seized upon him mightily, and the
    beloved One hath gained high power of life.

   O Asura, disclose thou and make visible the Cow's beloved
    home to the bright golden Sun.
 [2003202]O Indra, let the eager wishes of the folk bring thee the golden-
    jawed, delightful, on thy car.
   That, pleased with sacrifice wherein ten fingers toil, thou mayest
    at the feast drink of our offered mead.
 [2003203]Juices aforetime, Lord of Bays, thou drankest, and thine, and
    only thine, is this libation.
   Gladden thee, Indra, with the mead-rich Soma: pour it down
    ever, Mighty One, within thee.

    ed for thee enhance thy rapture.
 [2003302]To make thee start, a strong true draught I offer to thee the
   Bull, O thou whom bay steeds carry.
   Here take delight, O Indra, in our voices while thou art hymned
    with power and all our spirit. [p. 290]
 [2003303]O mighty Indra, through thine aid, thy prowess, obtaining life,

HYMN XXXIV

[2003401]He who just born, chief God of lofty spirit, by power and might
    became the God's protector,
   Before whose breath, through greatness of his valour, the two
    worlds trembled, He, O men, is Indra.
 [2003402]He who fixed fast and firm the earth that staggered, and set at
    rest the agitated mountains,
   Who measured out air's wider middle region and gave the
    heaven support, He, O men, is Indra.
 [2003403]Who slew the Dragon, freed the Seven Rivers, and draye the
    kine forth from the cave of Vala,
   Begat the fire between both stones, the spoiler in warrior's
    battle, He, O men, is Indra.
 [2003404]By whom this universe was made to tremble, who chased away
    the humbled brood of demon,
   Who, like a gambler gathering his winnings, seized the foe's
    riches, He, O men, is Indra.
 [2003405]Of whom, the terrible, they ask, Where is He? or verily they
    say of him, He is not.
   He wastes the foeman's wealth like stakes of gamblers. Have
    faith in him for He, O men, is Indra.
 [2003406]Stirrer to action of the poor and lowly, of priest, of suppliant
    who sings his praises
   Who, fair-faced, favours him who presseth Soma with stones
    adjusted, He, O men, is Indra.
 [2003407]He under whose supreme control are horses, all chariots, and
    the hamlets, and the cattle:
   He who begat the Sun, begat the Morning, leader of waters.
   He, O men, is Indra.
 [2003408]To whom both armies cry in close encounter, foe against foe, the
    stronger and the weaker; [p. 291]
   Whom two invoke upon one chariot mounted, each for himself,
   He, O ye men, is Indra.
 [2003409]He, without whom men conquer not in battle, whom, warring,
    they invoke for help and succour;
   He, all this universe's type and image, who shakes what never
    shook, He, men, is Indra.
 [2003410]He who hath smitten, ere they know their danger, with his hurl-
    ed weapon many grievous sinners:
   Who pardons not his boldness who provokes him, who slays the
   Dasyu, He, O men, is Indra.
 [2003411]He who discovered in the fortieth autumn Sambara dwelling in
    the midst of mountains:
   Who slew the Dragon putting forth his vigour, the demon lying
    there, He, men, is Indra.
 [2003412]Who drank the juice poured at the seas of Order, subduing
   Sambara by superior prowess,
   Who hoarded food within the mountain's hollow wherein he
    grew in strength, He, men, is Indra.
 [2003413]Who, with seven guiding reins, the Bull, the mighty, set the
   Seven Rivers free to flow at pleasure;
   Who, thunder-armed, rent Rauhina in pieces when scaling
    heaven, He, O ye men, is Indra.
 [2003414]Heaven, even, and the earth bow down before him, before his
    very breath the mountains tremble.
   Known as the Soma-drinker, armed with thunder, the wielder
    of the bolt, He, men, is Indra.
 [2003415]Who aids with favour him who pours the Soma, and him who
    brews it, sacrificer, singer;
   Whose strength our prayer and offered Soma heighten, and this
    our gift, He, O ye men, is Indra.
 [2003416]Born, manifested in his Parents' bosom, He knoweth as a son
    the Highest Father.
   He who with vigorous energy assisted the companies of Gods,
   He, men, is Indra
 [2003417]Lord of Bay steeds, who loves the flowing Soma, He before
    whom all living creatures tremble.
   He who smote Sambara and slaughtered Sushna, He the Sole
   Hero, He, O men, is Indra.
 [2003418]Thou verily art true strong God who sendest wealth to the man
    who brews and pours libation. [p. 292]
   So may we evermore, thy friends, O Indra, address the synod
    with brave sons about us.

HYMN XXXV

[2003501]To him, to him swift, strong, and high-exalted, I bring my song
    of praise as dainty viands;
   My thought to him resistless, meet for praises, prayers offered
    most devotedly to Indra. [p. 293]
 [2003502]To him I offer praise as choice refreshment, bring forth my song,
    with seemly laud besiege him.
   For Indra, Lord of olden time, the singers shall deck their hymns
    with heart and mind and spirit.
 [2003503]To him then with my lips my song of praises, excellent, winning
    heavenly light, I offer,
   To magnify with hymns of invocation and eulogies the Lord,
    most bounteous Giver.
 [2003504]Even for him I frame a laud--so fashions the wright a chariot
    for the man who needs it
   Songs for wise Indra hymned with invocation, a song composed
    with care and all-impelling.
 [2003505]So with my tongue I deck, to please that Indra, my hymn as't-
    were a horse, through love of glory,
   To reverence the Hero, bounteous Giver, famed far and wide,
    destroyer of the castles.
 [2003506]Even for him hath Tvashtar forged the thunder, most deftly
    wrought, celestial, for the battle.
   Wherewith he reached the vital parts of Vritra, striking--the
    vast, the mighty--with the striker,
 [2003507]As soon as, at libations of his mother, great Vishnu had drunk
    up the draught, he plundered.
   The dainty cates, the cooked mess; but One stronger transfixed
    the wild boar, shooting through the mountain.
 [2003508]To him, to Indra when he slew the Dragon, the Dames too,
   Consorts of the Gods, wove praises.
   The mighty heaven and earth hath he encompassed: thy great-
    ness heaven and earth, combined, exceed not.
 [2003509]Yea, of a truth, his magnitude surpasseth the magnitude of
    earth, mid-air and heaven.
   Indra whom all men praise, the Sovran Ruler, waxed in his
    home loud-voiced and strong for battle.
 [2003510]Through his own strength with bolt of thunder Indra smote
    piece-meal Vritra, drier up of waters.
   He let the floods go free, like cows imprisoned, for glory, with
    a heart inclined to bounty.
 [2003511]Through his resplendent power still stood the rivers when with
    his bolt on every side he stayed them. [p. 294]
   With lordly might favouring him who worshipped, he made a
    ford, victorious, for Turviti.
 [2003512]Vast, with thine ample power, with eager movement against this
   Vritra cast thy bolt of thunder.
   Rend thou his joints, as of an ox dissevered, with bolt oblique
    that floods of rain may follow.
 [2003513]Sing with new lauds his exploits wrought aforetime, the deeds
    of him, yea, him who moveth swiftly,
   When, hurling forth his weapons in the battle, he with impetuous
    wrath lays low the foemen.
 [2003514]When he, yea, he is born the firm-set mountains and the whole
    heaven and earth tremble in terror.
   May Nodhas ever lauding the protection of this dear Friend win
    straightway strength heroic.
 [2003515]Now unto him of these things hath been given what he, who
    rules alone o'er much, electeth.
   Indra helped Etasa, the Soma presser, contending in the chariot-
    race with Surya.
 [2003516]Thus to thee, Indra, yoker of bay coursers, the Gotamas have
    brought their prayers and praises.
   Bestow upon them thought, decked with all beauty. May he,
    enriched with prayer, come soon and early.

HYMN XXXVI

[2003601]With these my hymns I glorify that Indra who is alone to be
    invoked by mortals. [p. 296]
   The Lord, the Mighty One, of manly vigour, victorious, Hero,
    true, and full of wisdom.
 [2003602]Our ancient sires, Navagvas, sages seven, while urging him to
    show his might, extolled him,
   Dweller on heights, swift smiting down opponents, guileless in
    word, and in his thoughts most mighty.
 [2003603]We seek that Indra to obtain his riches that yield much food,
    and men, and store of heroes.
   O Lord of Bay Steeds, bring to make us joyful, celestial wealth
    abundant, undecaying.
 [2003604]Declare to us--if at thy hand aforetime the earlier singers have
    obtained good fortune
   What is thy share and portion, strong Subduer, Asura-slayer,
    rich, invoked of many?
 [2003605]He who for car-borne, thunder-wielding Indra, hath a hymn,
    craving deeply-piercing, fluent,
   Who sends a song effectual, firmly-grasping, and strength-
    bestowing, he comes near the mighty.
 [2003606]Strong of thyself! thou with this art hast shattered with thought-
    swift Parvata, him who waxed against thee;
   And, Mightiest! rager! boldly rent in pieces things that were
    firmly fixed and never shaken..
 [2003607]Him will we fit for you with new devotion, the strongest,
   Ancient One, in ancient manner.
   So way that Indra, boundless, faithful leader, conduct us o'er all
    places hard to traverse.
 [2003608]Thou for the people who oppress hast kindled the earthly firma-
    ment and that of heaven.
   With heat, O Bull, on every side consume them heat earth and
    flood for him who hates devotion:
 [2003609]Of all the heavenly folk, of earthly creatures, thou art the King,
   O God of splendid aspect.
   In thy right hand, O Indra, grasp the thunder: Eternal! thou
    destroyest all enchantments.
 [2003610]Give us confirmed prosperity, O Indra, vast and exhaustless for
    the foes' subduing.
   Strengthen therewith the Arya's hate and Dasa's; and let the
    arms of Nahushas be mighty.
 [2003611]Come with thy teams which bring all blessings, hither, disposer,
    much-invoked, exceeding holy! [p. 297]
   Come to me swiftly with these teams of coursers, these which
    no fiend, no God may stay or hinder.

HYMN XXXVII

[2003701]He, like a bull with sharpened horns, terrific, singly excites and
    agitates all the people.
   Then givest him who largely pours libation his wealth who pours
    not, for his own possession.
 [2003702]Thou verily, Indra, gavest help to Kutsa, willingly lending ear
    to him in battle.
   When, aiding Arjunneya, thou subduedst to him both Kuyava and
    the Dasa Sushna.
 [2003703]O Bold One, thou with all thine aids hast boldly helped Sudas
    whose offerings were accepted,
   Puru in winning land and slaying foemen, and Trasadasyu son
    of Purukutsa.
 [2003704]At the Gods' banquet, Hero-souled! with heroes, Lord of Bay
   Steeds, thou slewest many Vritras.
   Thou sentest in swift death to sleep the Dasyu, both Chumuri
    and Dhuni, for Dabhiti,
 [2003705]These were thy mighty powers that, Thunder-wielder! then
    swiftly crushedst nine-and ninety castles. [p. 298]
   Thou capturedst the hundredth in thine onslaught; thou slewest
   Namuchi, thou slewest Vritra.
 [2003706]Old are the blessings, Indra, which thou gavest Sudas the wor-
    shipperwho brought oblations.
   For thee, the strong I yoke thy strong bay horses: let them,
    approach our prayers and wealth, Most Mighty!
 [2003707]Give us not up, Lord of Bay Horses, victor, in this our time of-
    trouble, to the wicked.
   Deliver us with true and faithful succour: dear may we be to
    thee among the princes.
 [2003708]May we men, Bounteous Lord, the friends thou lovest, near i
    thee be joyful under thy protection.
   Fain to fulfil the wish of Atithigva, bow Turvasa, bow down,.
    the son of Yadu.
 [2003709]Swiftly, in truth, O Bounteous Lord, about thee men skilled im
    hymning sing their songs and praises.
   Elect us shares of their love and friendship who by their calls on,
    thee despoiled the niggards.
 [2003710]Thine are these Lauds, O manliest of heroes, Lauds which revert
    to us and give us riches.
   Favour these, Indra, when they strike the foemen, as Friend and
   Hero and the heroes' helper.
 [2003711]Now, lauded for thine aid, heroic Indra, sped by our prayer,,
    wax mighty in thy body.
   To us apportion wealth and habitations. Ye Gods, protect us-
    evermore with blessings.

[2004601]Him who advances men to wealth, sends light to lead them in
    their wars,
   And quells their foemen in the fray:
 [2004602]May he, the saviour much-invoked, may Indra bear us in a ship
   Safely beyond all enemies.
 [2004603]As such, O Indra, honour us with wealth and treasure: further

HYMN XLVII

[2004701]We make this Indra show his strength, to strike the mighty
   Vritra dead:
   A vigorous Hero shall he be.
 [2004702]Indra was made for giving, most powerful, friendly in carouse,
   Bright, meet for Soma, famed in song. [p. 304]
 [2004703]By song, as 'twere, the mighty bolt, which none may parry, was
    prepared:
   Lofty, invincible he grew.
 [2004710]They who stand round him as he moves harness the bright, the
    ruddy Steed:
   The lights are shining in the sky.
 [2004711]They yoke on both sides to the car the two bay coursers dear to
    him,
   Bold, tawny, bearers of the Chief.
 [2004712]Thou, making light where no light was, and form, O Men r
    where no form was,
   Wast born together with the Dawns,
 [2004713]His bright rays bear him up aloft, the God who knoweth all that=
    is,
   Surya, that every one may see.
 [2004714]The constellations pass away, like thieves, together with their-
    beams,
   Before the all-beholding Sun.
 [2004715]His herald rays are seen afar refulgent o'er the world of men,
   Like fiery flames that burn and blaze.
 [2004716]Swift and all-beautiful art thou, O Surya, maker of the light.
   Illuming all the radiant realm.
 [2004717]Thou guest to the troops of Gods, thou comest hither to man-
    kind,
   Hither, all light for us to see.
 [2004718]Thou with that eye of thine wherewith thou seest, brilliant.
   Varuna,
   The active one throughout mankind.
 [2004719]Pervadest heaven and wide mid-air, melting the days out with.
    thy beams,
   Sun, seeing all things that have birth.
 [2004720]Seven bay steeds, harnessed to thy car, bear thee, O.thou far-
    seeing One,
   God, Surya, thee with radiant hair.
 [2004721]Surya hath yoked the seven bright mares, the daughters of the
    car: With these,
   His own dear team, he travelleth.

    vigour, as
   A dame her infant with her heart.
 [2004803]Fair hymns bring glory to the Strong, and Indra-vigour; unto,
    me
   Fatness and milk and length of days.
 [2004804]This brindled Bull hath come and sat before the Mother in the
    east,
   Advancing to the Father Heaven.
 [2004805]As expiration from breath she moves along the lucid spheres:
   The Bull shines forth through all the sky.
 [2004806]Song is bestowed upon the Bird. It reigns supreme throughout
    thirty realms
   Throughout the days at break of morn.

    in heaven
   He, the most bounteous, hath been glad.
 [2004903]Praise with the voice the Mighty: he rules in each realm. In
    transport he
   Hath set upon the sacred grass.
 [2004904]As cows low to their calf in stalls, so with our songs we glorify
   This Indra, even your wondrous God who checks attack, who
    joys in the delightful juice.
 [2004905]Celestial, bounteous Giver, God, with power and might, rich,
    mountain-like, in precious things.
   Him soon we see for foodful booty rich in kine, brought
    hundredfold and thousandfold.
 [2004906]I crave of thee that hero strength--that thou mayst first regard
    this prayer
   Wherewith thou helpest Bhrigu and the Yatis and Praskanva
    when the prize was staked.
 [2004907]Wherewith thou sentest mighty waters to the sea--Indra, that
    manly strength of thine.
   For ever unattainable is this power of him to whom the worlds
    have cried aloud.

   As from a mountain flow the water-brooks, thus flow his gifts
    who feedeth many a one.
 [2005103]Sakra I praise, for victory, far-famed, exceeding bountiful.
   Who gives, as 'twere in thousands, precious wealth to him who
    sheds the juice and worships him.
 [2005104]Arrows with hundred points, unconquerable, are this Indra's
    mighty arms in war.

    juices poured have gladdened him.

   Gather in both thy hands for us treasures of many hundred

   The Somas mingled with the curd.
 [2006904]Thou, grown at once to perfect strength, wast born to drink the
   Soma juice, strong Indra, for preeminence.
 [2006905]O Indra, lover of the song, may these quick Somas enter thee:
   May they bring bliss to thee the Sage.
 [2006900]6. O Lord of Hundred Powers, our chants of praise and lauds have
    strengthened thee:
   So strengthen thee the songs we sing!
 [2006907]Indra, whose succour never fails, accept this treasure thousand-

 [2008703]Thou, newly-born, for strength didst drink the Soma; thy

    strength of arm, we will subdue them.
   Or, Indra, when thou fightest girt by heroes, we in the glorious
    fray with thee will conquer.
 [2008705]I will declare the earliest deeds of Indra, and recent acts which
   Maghavan hath accomplished.
   When he had conquered godless wiles and magic, Soma became

   Quell with your voice the wicked's voice, O sages, Singer, make
   Indra rest beside the Soma.
 [2008902]Draw thy Friend to thee like a cow at milking: O singer, wake
    up Indra as a lover.
   Make thou the Hero haste to give us riches even as a vessel
    filled brimful with treasure.
 [2008903]Why, Maghavan, do they call thee bounteous Giver? Quicken
    me: thou, I hear, art he who quickens.
   Sakra, let my intelligence be active, and bring us luck that finds
    great wealth, O Indra.
 [2008904]Standing, in battle for their rights, together, the people, Indra,
    in the fray invoke thee.
   Him who brings gifts the Hero makes his comrade: with him
    who pours no juice he seeks not friendship.
 [2008905]Whoso with plenteous juice for him expresses strong Somas as
    much quickly-coming treasure,
   For him he everthrows in early morning his swift well-weapon-
    ed foes and slays the tyrant.
 [2008906]He unto whom we offer praises, Indra, Maghavan, who hath
    joined to ours his wishes
   Before him even afar the foe must tremble: low before him must
    bow all human glories.
 [2008907]With thy fierce bolt, O God invoked of many, drive to a distance
    from afar the foeman.
   O Indra, give us wealth in corn and cattle, and make the singer's
    prayer gain strength and riches.
 [2008908]Indra the swallower of strong libations with their thick residue,
    the potent Somas,
   He, Maghavan, will not restrict his bounty: he brings much
    wealth unto the Soma-presser.
 [2008909]Yea, by superior play he wins advantage when he, a gambler,
    piles his gains in season. [p. 335]
   Celestial-natured, he o'erwhelms with riches the devotee who
    keeps not back his money.
 [2008910]O much-invoked, may we subdue all famine and evil want with
    store of grain and cattle.
   May we allied, as first in rank, with princes,:obtain possessions
    by our own exertion
 [2008911]Brihaspati protect us from the rearward, and from above and
    from below, from sinners.
   May Indra from the front and from the centre, as friend to
    friends, vouchsafe us room and freedom.

[2009001]Served with oblations, first-born, mountain-render, Angiras' Son,
   Brihaspati the holy.
   With twice-firm path, dwelling in light, our Father, roars loudly,
    as a bull, to earth and heaven.
 [2009002]Brihaspati who made for such a people wide room and verge
    when Gods were invocated--
   Slaying his foe he breaketh down their cattles, quelling his
    enemies and those who hate him.
 [2009003]Brihaspati in war hath won rich treasures, hath won, this God,
    the great stalls filled with cattle.
   Striving to win waters and light, resistless, Brihaspati with light-
    ning smites the foeman.

HYMN XCI

[2009101]This holy hymn sublime and seven-headed, sprung from eternal
   Law, our sire discovered.
   Ayasya, friend of all men, hath engendered the fourth hymn as
    he sang his laud to Indra.
 [2009102]Thinking aright, praising eternal Order, the sons of Dyaus the
   Asura, those heroes,
   Angirases, holding the rank of sages, first honoured sacrifice's
    holy statute.
 [2009103]Girt by his friends who cried with swanlike voices, bursting the
    stoney barriers of the prison,
   Brihaspati spake in thunder to the cattle, and uttered praise and.
    song when he had found them.
 [2009104]Apart from one, away from two above him, he draye the kine
    that stood in bonds of falsehood.
   Brihaspati, seeking light amid the darkness, draye forth the
    bright cows: three he made apparent.
 [2009105]When he had cleft the lairs and western castle, he cut off three
    from him who held the waters.
   Brihaspati discovered, while he thundered like Dyaus, the dawn,.
    the sun, the cow, the lightning.
 [2009106]As with a hand, so with his roaring Indra cleft Vala through,.
    the guardian of the cattle.
   Seeking the milk-draught with sweat-shining comrades he stole:
    the Pani's kine and left him weeping.
 [2009107]He with bright faithful friends, winners of booty, hath rent the
    milker of the cows asunder.
   Brihaspati with wild boars strong and mighty sweating with heat
    hath gained a rich possession.
 [2009108]They, longing for the kine, with faithful spirit incited with their
    hymns the Lord of cattle.
   Brihaspati freed the radiant cows with comrades self-yoked,.
    averting shame from one another.
 [2009109]In our assembly with auspicious praises exalting him who roareth.
    like a lion.
   May we in every fight where heroes conquer rejoice in strong.
   Brihaspati the victor.
 [2009110]When he had won him strength of every nature and gone to
    heaven and its most lofty mansions, [p. 337]
   Men praised Brihaspati the mighty, bringing the light within
    their mouths from sundry places.
 [2009111]Fulfil the prayer that begs for vital vigor: aid in your wonted
    manner e'en the humble.
   Let all our foes be turned and driven backward. Hear this, O
   Heaven and Earth, ye all-producers.
 [2009112]Indra with mighty strength hath cleft asunder the head of Arbuda
    the watery monster,
   Slain Ahi, and set free the Seven Rivers. O Heaven and Earth,
    with all the Gods, protect us.

HYMN XCII

[2009201]Praise, even as he is known, with song Indra the guardian of the
    kine,
   The Son of Truth, Lord of the brave.
 [2009202]Hither his bay steeds have been sent, red steeds are on the sacred
    grass.
   Where we in concert sing our songs. [p. 338]
 [2009203]For Indra thunder-armed the kine have yielded mingled milk
    and meath.
   What time he found them in the vault.
 [2009204]When I and Indra amount on high up to the bright One's place
    and home,
   We, having drunk of meath, will reach his seat whose Friends
    are three-times-seven.
 [2009205]Sing, sing ye forth your songs of praise, ye Priyamedhas, sing
    your songs:
   Yea, let young children sing their lauds: as a strong castle praise
    ye him.
 [2009206]Now loudly let the viol sound, the lute send out its voice with
    might,
   Shrill be the music of the string. To Indra is the hymn upraised.
 [2009207]When hither speed the dappled cows, unflinching, easy to be
    milked,
   Seize quickly, as it bursts away, the Soma juice for Indra's
    drink.
 [2009208]Indra hath drunk; Agni hath drunk all Deities have drunk their
    fill.
   Here Varuna shall have his home, to whom the floods have sung
    aloud as mother-kine unto their calves.
 [2009209]Thou, Varuna, to whom belong the Seven Streams, art a glorious
   God.
   The waters flow into thy throat as'twere a pipe with ample
    mouth.
 [2009210]He who hath made the fleet steeds spring, well-harnessed, to the
    worshipper,
   He, the swift guide, is that fair form thot loosed the horses near
    at hand.
 [2009211]Indra, the very mighty, holds his enemies in utter scorn.
   He, far away, and yet a child, cleft the cloud smitten by his
    voice.
 [2009212]He, yet a boy exceeding small, mounted his newly-fashioned car.
   He for his Mother and his Sire cooked the wild mighty buffalo.
 [2009213]Lord of the Home, with beauteous cheeks, ascend thy chariot
    wrought of gold.
   We will attend the heavenly One; the thousand-footed, red of
    hue, matchless, who blesses where he goes.
 [2009214]With reverence they come hitherward to him as to a sovran lord, [p. 339]
   That they may bring him near for this man's good success, to
    prosper and bestow his gifts.
 [2009215]The Priyamedhas have observed the offering of the men of old,
   Of ancient custom, while they strewed the sacred grass and
    spread their sacrificial food.
 [2009216]He who as sovran Lord of men moves with his chariots
    unrestrained,
   The Vritra-slayer, queller of all fighting hosts, preeminent, is
    praised in song.
 [2009217]Honour that Indra, Puruhanman! for his aid, in whose sustain-
    ing hand of old.
   The splendid bolt of thunder was deposited, as the great Sun
    was set in heaven.
 [2009218]No one by deed attains to him who works and strengthens
    evermore:
   No, not by sacrifice, to Indra praised of all, resistless, daring,
    bold in might;
 [2009219]The potent Conqueror, invincible in war, him at whose birth
    the mighty ones,
   The kine who spread afar, sent their loud voices out, heavens,
    earths sent their loud voices out.
 [2009220]O Indra, if a hundred heavens and if a hundred earths were
    thine
   No, not a thousand suns could match thee at thy birth, not
    both the worlds, O Thunderer.
 [2009221]Thou, Hero, hast performed thy hero deeds with might, yea, all
    with strength, O Strongest One.
   Maghavan, help us to a stable full of kine, O Thunderer, with
    wondrous aids.

   Might art thou:

 [2009303]Thou art the Lord of Soma pressed, Soma unpressed is also
    thine,
   Thou art the Sovran of the folk.
 [2009304]Swaying about the active Ones came nigh to Indra at his birth,
   And shared his great heroic might.
 [2009305]Based upon strength and victory and power, O Indra is thy
    birth.
   Thou, Mighty One, art strong indeed.
 [2009306]Thou art the Vritra-slayer, thou, Indra, hast spread the
    firmament:
   Thou hast with might upheld the heavens.
 [2009307]Thou, Indra, bearest in thine arms the lightning that accords

HYMN XCIV

[2009401]May Sovran Indra come to the carousal, he who by holy Law is
    strong and active.
   The overcomer of all conquering forces with his great bull-like
    power that hath no limit.
 [2009402]Firm-seated is thy car, thy steeds are docile: thy hand, O King,
    holds, firmly grasped, the thunder.
   On thy fair path, O Lord of men, come quickly: we will increase
    thy power when thou hast drunken.
 [2009403]Let strong and mighty steeds who bear this mighty Indra, the
   Lord of men, whose arm wields thunder,
   Bring unto us, as shares of our banquet, the Bull of conquering
    might, of real vigour.
 [2009404]So like a bull thou rushest to the Lord who loves the trough,
    the Sage, the prop of vigour, in the vat.
   Prepare thine energies, collect them in thyself: be for our profit
    as the Master of the wise.
 [2009405]May precious treasures come to us,-- so will I pray. Come to the
    votary's gift offered with beauteous laud.
   Thou art the Lord, as such sit on this holy grass: thy vessels
    are inviolate as Law commands.
 [2009406]Far went our earliest invocations of the Gods, and won us
    glories that can never be surpassed.
   They who could not ascend the ship of sacrifice sink down in
    desolation, trembling with alarm.
 [2009407]So be the others, evil-hearted, far away, whose horses difficult to
    harness have been yoked.
   Here in advance man stand anear to offer gifts, by whom full
    many a work that brings reward is done.
 [2009408]He firmly fixed the plains and mountains as they shook. Dyaus
    thundered forth and made the air's mid-region quake.
   He stays apart the two confronting bowls; he sings lauds in the
    potent Soma's joy when he hath drunk.
 [2009409]I bear this deftly-fashioned goad of thine wherewith thou,
   Maghavan, shalt break the strikers with the hoof. [p. 342]
   At the libation mayst thou be well satisfied. Partake the juice,
    partake the banquet, Bounteous Lord.
 [2009410]O Much-invoked, may we subdue all famine and evil want with
    store of grain and cattle.
   May we allied, as first in rank, with princes, obtain possessions
    by our own exertions.
 [2009411]Brihaspati protect us from the rearward, and from above, and

[2009501]From the three jars the Great and Strong hath drunk drink blent

   That hath so heightened him the Great, the Vast, to do his
    mighty work.
   So may the God attend the God, true Indu Indra who is true.

   Giver of room in closest fight, slayer of foes in shock of war, be
    thou our great encourager. Let the weak bowstrings break
    upon the bows of feeble enemies.
 [2009503]Thou didst destroy the Dragon: thou sentest the rivers down to
    earth.
   Foeless, O Indra, wast thou born. Thou tendest well each
    choicest thing. Therefore we draw us close to thee. Let the
    weak bowstrings break upon the bows of feeble enemies.
 [2009504]Destroyed be all malignities and all our enemy's designs.

[2009601]Taste this strong draught that gives thee vital vigour: with all
    thy chariot here unyoke thy coursers.
   Let not those other sacrificers stay thee, Indra: these juices shed
    for thee are ready.
 [2009602]Thine is the juice effused, thine are the juices yet to be pressed:
    our resonant songs invite thee.
   O Indra, pleased to-day with this libation, come, thou who
    knowest all, and drink the Soma.
 [2009603]Whoso, devoted to the God, effuses Soma for him with yearning
    heart and spirit,
   Never doth Indra give away his cattle: for him he makes the
    lovely Soma famous.
 [2009604]He looks with loving favour on the mortal who, like a rich man,
    pours for him the Soma.
   Maghavan in his bended arm supports him: he slays, unasked,
    the men who hate devotion.
 [2009605]We call on thee to come to us, desirous of booty, and of cattle,
    and of horses. [p. 344]
   For thy new love and favour are we present: let us invoke thee,
   Indra, as our welfare.
 [2009606]For life I set thee free by this oblation from the unknown
    decline and from consumption;
   Or, if the grasping demon have possessed him, free him from
    her, O Indra, thou and Agni.
 [2009607]Be his days ended, be he how departed, be he brought very near
    to death already,
   Out of Destruction's lap again I bring him, save him for life to
    last a hundred autumns.
 [2009608]With thousand-eyed oblation, hundred-autumned, bringing a
    hundred lives, have 1 restored him.
   That Indra for a hundred years may lead him safe to the farther
    shore of all misfortune.
 [2009609]Live waxing in thy strength a hundred autumns, live through a
    hundred springs, a hundred winters.
   Through hundred-lived oblation Indra, Agni, Brihaspati, Savitar
    yield him for a hundred!
 [2009610]So have I found and rescued thee: thou hast returned with
    youth renewed.
   Whole in thy members! I have found whole sight and all thy
    life for thee.
 [2009611]May Agni yielding to our prayer, the Rakshas-killer, drive away.
   The malady of evil name that hath beset thy labouring womb.
 [2009612]Agni, concurring in the prayer, drive off the eater of thy flesh,
   The malady of evil name that hath attacked thy babe and
    womb.
 [2009613]That which destroys the sinking germ, the settled, moving
    embryo,
   That which would kill the babe at birth, even this will we drive
    far away.
 [2009614]That which divides thy legs that it may lie between the married
    pair,
   That penetrates and licks thy side, even this will we exterminate.
 [2009615]What rests by thee in borrowed form of brother, lover, or of
    lord,
   And would destroyed the progeny,--even this will we exter-
    minate.
 [2009616]That which through sleep or darkness hath deceived thee and
    lies down by thee, [p. 345]
   And will destroy thy progeny,--even this will we exterminate.
 [2009617]From both thy nostrils, from thine eyes, from both thine ears
    and from thy chin,
   Forth from thy head and brain and tongue I drive thy malady
    away.
 [2009618]From the neck-tendons and the neck, from the breast-bones
    and from the spine,
   From shoulders, upper, lower arms, I drive thy malady away.
 [2009619]From viscera and all within, forth from the rectum, from the
    heart,
   From kidneys, liver and from spleen, I drive thy malady away.
 [2009620]From thighs, from knee-caps, and from heels, and from the
    forepart of the feet,
   From hips, from stomach, and from groin, I drive thy malady
    away.
 [2009621]From what is voided from within, and from thy hair, and from
    thy nails,
   From all thyself, from top to toe, I drive thy malady away.
 [2009622]From every member, every hair, disease that comes in every
    joint,
   From all thyself, from top to toe, I drive thy malady away.
 [2009623]Avaunt, thou Master of the Mind, I Depart and vanish far away.
   Look on Destruction far from us. The live man's mind is

[2010501]Thou in the battles, Indra, art subduer of all hostile bands.
   Father art thou, all-conquering, cancelling the curse, thou victor
    of the vanquisher.
 [2010502]The earth, and heaven cling close to thy victorious might, as sire
    and mother to their child.
   When thou attackest Vritra all the hostile bands shrink and
    faint, Indra at thy wrath.
 [2010503]Bring to your aid the Eternal One, who shoots and none may
    shoot at him,
   Inciter, swift, victorious, best of charioteers, Tugrya's unvan-
    quished strengthener;

[2010701]Before his hot displeasure all the peoples, all the men bow
    down,
   As rivers bend them to the sea.
 [2010702]This power of his shone brightly forth when Indra brought to-
    gether like
   A skin the worlds of earth and heaven.
 [2010703]The fiercely-moving Vritra's head he severed with his thunder-
    bolt,
   His hundred-knotted thunderbolt.
 [2010704]In all the worlds That was the best and highest whence sprang
    the mighty God, of splendid valour.
   As soon as born he overcomes his foemen, he in whom all who
    lend him aid are joyful.
 [2010705]Grown mighty in his strength, with ample vigour, he as a foe
    strikes fear into the Dasa,
   Eager to win the breathing and the breathless. All sang thy
    praise at banquet and oblation.
 [2010706]All concentrate on thee their mental vigour, what time these,
    twice or thrice, are thine assistants.
   Blend what is sweeter than the sweet with sweetness: win quickly
    with our meath that meath in battle.
 [2010707]Therefore in thee too, thou who winnest riches, at every banquet
    are the sages joyful
   With mighter power, bold God, extend thy firmness: let not
    malignant Yatudhanas harm thee.
 [2010708]Proudly we put our trust in thee in battles, when we behold great
    wealth the prize of combat.
   I with my words impel thy weapons onward, and sharpen with
    my prayer thy vital vigour.
 [2010709]Worthy of praises many-shaped, most skilful, most energetic,
   Aptya of the Aptyas: [p. 351]
   He with his might destroys the seven Danus, subduing many
    who were deemed his equals.
 [2010710]Thou in that house which thy protection guardedh bestowest-
    wealth, the higher and the lower.
   Thou stablishest the two much-wandering Mothers, and bringest
    many deeds to their completion.
 [2010711]Brihaddiva, the foremost of light-winners, repeasts these holy
    prayers, this strength to Indra.
   He rules the great self-luminous fold of cattle, and all the doors
    of light hath he thrown open.
 [2010712]Thou hath Brihaddiva the great Atharvan, spoken to Indra as
    himself in person.
   The Matarisvaris, the spotless sisters, with power exalt him and
    impel him onward.
 [2010713]Bright, Presence of the Gods, the luminous herald, Siirya hath
    mounted the celestial regions.
   Day's maker, he hath shone away the darkness, and radiant
    passed o'er places hard to traverse.
 [2010714]The brilliant Presence of the Gods hath risen, the eye of Mitra,
   Varuna, and Agni.
   The soul of all that moveth not or moveth, Surya hath filled the
    earth and air and heaven.
 [2010715]Even as a lover followeth a maiden, so doth the Sun the Dawn,
    refulgent Goddess:
   Where pious men extend their generations before the Gracious
   One for happy fortune.

    wide shelter may be joyful.
 [2012502]What then? As men whose fields are full of barley reap the ripe
    corn removing it in order,
   So bring the food of those men, bring it hither, who come not
    to prepare the grass for worship.
 [2012503]Men come not with one horse at sacred seasons; thus they
    obtain no honour in assemblies.
   Sages desiring herds of kine and horses strengthen the mighty
   Indra for his friendship.
 [2012504]Ye, Asvins, Lords of Splendour, drank full draughts of grateful
   Soma juice,
   And aided Indra in his work with Namuchi of Asura birth.
 [2012505]As parents aid a son, both Asvins, Indra, aided thee with their
    wondrous powers and wisdom
   When thou, with might, hadst drunk the draught that glad-
    dens, Sarasvati, O Maghavan refreshed thee.
 [2012506]Indra is strong to save, rich in assistance: may he, possessing
    all, be kind and gracious.
   May he disperse our foes and give us safety, and may we be the
    lords of hero vigour.
 [2012507]May we enjoy his favour, his the holy: may we enjoy his blessed
    loving-kindness.
   May this rich Indra, as our good protector, drive off and keep
    afar all those who hate us.

[2012601]Men have abstained from pouring juice; nor counted Indra as a
   God.
   Where at the votary's store my friend Vrishakapi hath drunk his
    fill. Supreme is Indra over all.
 [2012602]Thou, Indra, heedless passest by the ill Vrishakapi hath
    wrought;

   O Indra, that Vrishakapi whom thou protectest as a friend.

   Why, O thou hero's wife, art thou angry with our Vrishakapi?
   Supreme is Indra over all.
 [2012609]This noxious creature looks on me as one bereft of hero's love. [p. 361]
   Yet heroes for my sons have I, the Maruts' friend and Indra's
   Queen Supreme is Indra over all.
 [2012610]From olden time the matron goes to feast and general sacrifice.
   Mother of heroes, Indra's Queen, the rite's ordainer is extolled.
   Supreme is Indra over all.
 [2012611]So have I heard Indrani called most fortunate among these
    dames,
   For never shall her Consort die in future time through length
    of days. Supreme is Indra over all.
 [2012612]Never, Indrani have I joyed without my friend Vrishakapi,
   Whose welcome offering here, made pure with water, goeth to
    the Gods. Supreme is Indra over all.

 [2012615]Like as a bull with pointed horn, loud bellowing amid the herds,
   Sweet to thine heart, O Indra, is the brew which she who tends
    thee pours. Supreme is Indra over all.
 [2012616]Indrani speaks. Non ille fortis (ad Venerem) est cujus mentula
    laxe inter femora dependet; fortis vero estille cujus, quum
    sederit, membrum pilosum se extendit. Super omnia est
    Indra.

    pilosum se extendit: fortis vero est ille cujus mentula laxe
    inter femora dependet. Super omnia est Indra.
 [2012618]O Indra, this Vrishakapi hath found a slain wild animal,
   Dresser, and new-made pan, and knife, and wagon with a load
    of wood. Supreme is Indra over all.
 [2012619]Distinguishing the Dasa and the Arya, viewing all, I go.
   I look upon the wise, and drink the simple votary's Soma juice.
   Supreme is Indra over all.
 [2012620]The desert plains and steep descents, how many leagues in length
    they spread!
   Go to the nearest houses, go unto thine home, Vrishakapi.
   Supreme is Indra over all.

   Thou goest homeward on thy way along this path which leads
    to sleep. Supreme is Indra over all.
 [2012622]When, Indra and Vrishakapi, ye travelled upward to your home,
   Where was that noisome beast, to whom went it, the beast that
    troubles man? Supreme is Indra over all.

A hymn in praise of the good Government of King Kaurama

[2012701]Listen to this, ye men, a laud of glorious bounty shall be sung.
   Thousands sixty, and ninety we, O Kaurama, among the
   Rusamas have received.
 [2012702]Camels twice-ten that draw the car, with females by their side,
    he gave.
   Fain would the chariot's top bow down escaping from the stroke
    of heaven.
 [2012703]A hundred chains of gold, ten wreaths, upon thee Rishi he
    bestowed,
   And thrice-a-hundred mettled steeds, ten-times-a-thousand cows
    he gave.
 [2012704]Glut thee, O Singer, glut thee like a bird on a ripe-fruited tree.
   Thy lips and tongue move swiftly like the sharp blades of a pair
    of shears.
 [2012705]Quickly and willingly like kine forth come the singers and their
    hymns:
   Their little maidens are at home, at home they wait upon the
    cows.
 [2012706]O Singer, bring thou forth the hymn that findeth cattle, findeth:
    wealth. [p. 364]
   Even as an archer aims his shaft address this prayer unto the

 [2012707]List to Parikshit's eulogy, the sovran whom all people love,
   The King who ruleth over all, excelling mortals as a God.
 [2012708]'Mounting his throne, Parikshit, best of all, hath given us peace

   Saith a Kauravya to his wife as he is ordering his house.
 [2012709]'Which shall I set before thee, curds, gruel of milk, or barley-
    brew?'
   Thus the wife asks her husband in the realm which King
   Parikshit rules.
 [2012710]Up as it were to heavenly light springs the ripe corn above the
    cleft.
   Happily thrive the people in the land where King Parikshit
    reigns.
 [2012711]Indra hath waked the bard and said, Rise, wander singing here
    and there.
   Praise me, the strong: each pious man will give thee riches in
    return,
 [2012712]Here, cows! increase and multiply, here ye, O horses, here, O
    men.
   Here, with a thousand rich rewards, doth Pushan also seat him-
    self.
 [2012713]O Indra, let these cows be safe, their master free from injury.
   Let not the hostile-hearted or the robber have control of them.
 [2012714]Oft and again we glorify the hero with our hymn of praise, with
    prayer, with our auspicious prayer.
   Take pleasure in the songs we sing: let evil never fall on us.

 [2012804]The most unprofitable churl, the wealthy men who brings no.
    gift,
   These, verily, as we have heard, are cast away by all the wise.
 [2012805]But they who have adored the Gods, and they who have best-
    owed their gifts,
   Those liberal lords are filled with wealth like Surya risen up to
    heaven.
 [2012806]With unanointed eyes and limbs, wearing no gem or ring of
    gold.
   No priest, no Brahman's son is he: these things are ordered in

 [2012807]With well-anointed limbs and eyes, wearing fair gem and golden,

 [2012808]Pools with no place for drinking, and the wealthy man who.
    giveth naught,
   The pretty girl you may not touch, these things are ordered in:

    fight,
   A sluggish horse whom none may guide, these things are order-
    ed in the rules.
 [2012811]The favourite wife most dearly loved, the man who safely goes
    to war,
   The fleet steed who obeys the rein, these things are ordered in
    the rules.
 [2012812]When, Indra, thou, as no man could, didst plunge into the Ten
   Kings' fight,
   That was a guard for every man: for he is formed to stay
    disease.
 [2012813]Easily conquering Maghavan, thou, Hero, bentest Raji down,
   Rentest asunder Rauhina, calvest in pieces Vritra's head.
 [2012814]Thou who didst separate the clouds and penetrate the water-
    floods,
   To thee, great slayer of the foe, be glory, Indra, yea, to thee!
 [2012815]They said to Auchchaihsravasa running as side-horse of the
   Bays,
   Safely to victory, O Steed, bear Indra with the beauteous wreath.
 [2012816]They yoke the white mares, on the Bay's right harness Auchchai-
    hsravasa.
   He joyeth as he carrieth Indra the foremost of the Gods.

HYMN CXXXVII

  

A composite hymn in praise of Indra

[2013701]When, foul with secret spot and stain, ye hastened onward to
    the breast.
   All Indra's enemies were slain and passed away like froth and
    foam.
 [2013702]Indra is he, O men, who gives us happiness: sport, urge the
    giver of delight to win the spoil.
   Bring quickly down, O priests, hither to give us aid, to drink
    the Soma, Indra son of Nishtigri.
 [2013703]So have I glorified with praise strong Dadhikravan, conquering
    steed.
   Sweet may he make our mouths; may he prolong the days we
    have to live.
 [2013704]The Somas very rich in sweets, for which the sieve is destined,
    flow,
   Effused, the source of Indra's joy. May your strong juices reach
    the Gods.
 [2013705]Indu flows on for Indra's sake--thus have the deities declared.
   The Lord of Speech exerts himself, ruler of all, because of
    might.
 [2013706]Inciter of the voice of song, with thousand streams the ocean
    flows,
   Even Soma, Lord of Opulence, the friend of Indra, day by day.
 [2013707]The black drop sank in Ansumati's bosom, advancing with ten
    thousand round about it.
   Indra with might longed for it as it panted: the hero-hearted
    laid aside his weapons.
 [2013708]I saw the drop in the far distance moving, on the slope bank of
   Ansumati's river,
   Like a black cloud that sank into the water. Heroes. I send you
    forth. Go, fight in battle.
 [2013709]And then the drop in Ansumati's bosom, splendid with light,
    assumed its proper body;
   And Indra with Brihaspati to aid him, conquered the godless
    tribes that came against him.
 [2013710]Then, at thy birth, thou wast the foeman, Indra, of those the
    seven who ne'er had met a rival. [p. 374]
   The hidden pair, the heaven and earth, thou foundest, and to
    the mighty worlds thou gavest pleasure.
 [2013711]So, Thunder-armed! thou with thy bolt of thunder didst boldly
    smite that power which none might equal;
   With weapons broughtest low the might of Sushna, and, Indra,
    foundest by thy strength the cattle.
 [2013712]We make this Indra very strong to strike the mighty Vritra
    dead:
   A vigorous Hero shall he be.
 [2013713]Indra was made for giving, set, most mighty, o'er the joyous
    draught,
   Bright, meet for Soma, famed in song.
 [2013714]By song, as 'twere, the powerful bolt which none may parry was
    prepared:
   Lofty, invincible he grew.

    and in growing plants,

 [2014003]Ye Asvins, now ascend your car that lightly rolls upon its way.
   May these my praises make you speed hitherward like a cloud of

Hymn to the Asvins

[2014301]We invocate this day your car, far-spreading, O Asvins, even
    the gathering of the sunlight,
   Car praised in hymns, most ample, rich in treasure, fitted with
    seats, the car that beareth Surya.
 [2014302]Asvins, ye gained that glory by your Godhead, ye Sons of
   Heaven, by your own might and power.
   Food followeth close upon your bright appearing when stately
    horses in your chariot draw you.
 [2014303]Who bringeth you to-day for help with offered oblations, or with
    hymns to drink the juices?
   Who, for the sacrifice's ancient lover, turneth you hither, Asvins,
    offering homage?
 [2014304]Borne on your golden car, ye omnipresent! come to this sacrifice
    of ours, Nasatyas.
   Drink of the pleasant liquor of the Soma: give riches to the
    people who adore you.[p. 379]
 [2014305]Come hitherward to us from earth, from heaven, borne on your
    golden chariot rolling lightly.
   Suffer not other worshippers to stay you: here are ye bound by
    earlier bonds of friendship.
 [2014306]Now for us both, mete out, O Wonder-Workers, riches exceed-
    ing great with store of heroes,
   Because the men have sent you praise, O Asvins, and Ajamilhas
    come to the laudation.
 [2014307]Whene'er I gratified you here together, your grace was given us,
   O ye rich in booty.
   Protect, ye twain, the singer of your praises: to you, Nasatyas,
    is my wish directed.
 [2014308]Sweet be the plants for us, the heavens, the waters, and full of
    sweets for us be air's mid-region!
   May the Field's Lord for us be full of sweetness, and may we
    follow after him uninjured.
 [2014309]Asvins, that work of yours deserves our wonder, the Bull of
    firmament and earth and heaven;
   Yes, and your thousand promises in battle. Come near to all
    these men and drink beside us.
