AUTHOR
------
Balarama Dasa (c. 1472-1552 CE) was one of the Panchasakha (Five Friends),
a group of five Odia saint-poets who pioneered Odia devotional literature.
He was a devotee of Lord Jagannatha and composed several works including
Lakshmi Purana, Bhava Samudra, and commentaries on Bhagavata Purana.

CONTENT SUMMARY
---------------
The Lakshmi Purana narrates the story of Goddess Lakshmi's visit to earth
during the month of Margashira (November-December). The text describes:

1. Verses 1-29: Introduction and the meeting of sages Narada and Parashara
2. Verses 30-114: Lakshmi's instructions on observing the Thursday vrata
3. Verses 115-160: Lakshmi visits homes and finds them unprepared
4. Verses 121-200: The story of Shriya, the Chandala woman who properly
   observes the vrata
5. Verses 200-400: Lord Jagannatha and Balabhadra's visit to Shriya's home
6. Verses 400-498: Reconciliation and the glory of observing Lakshmi Puja

The text is significant for its social message - depicting Goddess Lakshmi
honoring a Chandala (untouchable) woman's devotion while criticizing
upper-caste women who failed to observe proper rituals.
