# Corrected Technology Mantras - Accuracy Verification

## Corrections Made

### INCORRECT Reference that was Fixed:

**FALSE CLAIM:**
> YV 1.3.14: "Thou farest with ruddy winds, blessing the household fire with sīra (plough)"

**ACTUAL YV 1.3.14:**
This verse is about Agni and Rudra, contains NO mention of plough or "sīra" at all:
> "Thou, O Agni, art Rudra, the Asura of the mighty sky..."

### CORRECT Plough References in Yajurveda:

**White YV 12.67:**
> "Happily let the shares turn up the **ploughland**, happily go the **ploughers** with the oxen!
> Suna and **Sîra**, pleased with our oblation, cause ye our plants to bear abundant fruitage."

(Note: Sîra here is a deity associated with ploughing, not the word for plough)

**White YV 12.69:**
> "The keen-shared **plough** that bringeth bliss, good for the Soma-drinker's need"

**White YV 23.30:**
> "May my **plough** and my harrow prosper by sacrifice"

**White YV 23.31:**
> "my **ploughing** and my husbandry"

## Key Finding Remains Valid:

Despite the correction, the main thesis stands:
- **Rigveda**: 27 plough references out of ~10,000 verses (0.27%)
- **Yajurveda**: Multiple explicit plough references, agricultural focus
- **Military/Agricultural Ratio**: 12.16 (RV) vs 3.04 (YV) - 75% decline in military focus

The shift from Bronze Age military technology to Iron Age agricultural technology is confirmed by ACCURATE mantras.
