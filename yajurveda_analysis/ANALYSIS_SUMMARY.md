## Key Observations

### Major Differences
1. **Text Structure**:
   - Black: Combines multiple mantras per section with ॥ separators
   - White: Individual verses without combining

2. **Organization**:
   - Black: 7 Kandas → Prapathakas → Sections (3-level)
   - White: 40 Books → Verses (2-level)

3. **Content Volume**:
   - Black: ~2,200 mantras in 633 sections (avg 3.5 mantras/section)
   - White: ~1,952 individual verses

### Similarities
1. **Vocabulary**: Significant overlap in Sanskrit terminology
2. **Ritual Content**: Both texts serve Vedic ritual purposes
3. **Common Phrases**: Several key liturgical phrases appear in both

## Conclusions

1. **Limited Direct Overlap**: The sample comparison shows relatively low exact matches, suggesting the texts are largely independent compositions despite shared tradition.

2. **First 18 Books Claim**: The analysis provides **weak** support for this claim. While some similarity exists, it's not as extensive as the claim might suggest.

3. **Different Redactions**: The texts appear to represent different redactions or schools of the Yajurveda tradition, with Black being more elaborate (combining mantras) and White being more concise.

4. **Shared Heritage**: Despite structural differences, vocabulary analysis shows significant shared Sanskrit terminology, confirming their common Vedic heritage.

## Recommendations

1. **Manual Verification**: The computational analysis should be validated by Sanskrit scholars
2. **Contextual Study**: Compare the ritual applications of similar passages
3. **Historical Analysis**: Study the transmission history of both traditions
4. **Deeper Sampling**: Increase sample sizes for more accurate overlap estimates
