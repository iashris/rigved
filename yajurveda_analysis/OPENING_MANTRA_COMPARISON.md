```
इ॒षे त्वो॒र्जे त्वा॑ ।
वा॒यवः॑ स्थोपा॒यव॑स्स्थ ।
दे॒वो व॑स्सवि॒ता प्रार्प॑यतु॒ श्रेष्ठ॑तमाय॒ कर्म॑ण॒ ।
आ प्या॑यध्वमघ्निया देवभा॒ग ।

For food thee, for strength thee!

Ye are winds, ye are approachers.

Let the god Savitr impel you to the most excellent offering.

O invincible ones, swell with the share for the gods,
Full of strength, of milk, rich in offspring,
free from sickness, from disease.

Let no thief, no evil worker, have control over you.

Let Rudra's dart avoid you.

Abide ye, numerous, with this lord of cattle.

Do thou protect the cattle of the sacrificer.
```

**Length**: 249 characters
**Style**: Concise and compressed

**Sanskrit (with Vedic accents):**
```
इ॒षे त्वा॑ । ऊ॒र्जे त्वा॑ ।
वा॒यव॑ स्थ ।

Inviolable! swell his share for Indra.

No thief, no evil-minded man shall master you
rich in offspring, free from pain and sickness.

Be constant, numerous to this lord of cattle.
Guard thou the cattle of the Sacrificer.
```

## Key Differences

### 1. Length and Style
- **Black YV**: 301 characters - more elaborate
- **White YV**: 249 characters - more compact (~17% shorter)
- **Ratio**: Black is 1.2x longer, showing its characteristic verbosity

### 2. Deity References

**Black Yajurveda explicitly mentions:**
- Savitr (सवितृ) - the impeller
- **Rudra** (रुद्र) - "Let Rudra's dart avoid you"
- References "the gods" (देवभाग) in general

**White Yajurveda explicitly mentions:**
- Savitr (सवितृ) - the impeller
- **Indra** (इन्द्र) - "swell his share for Indra"
- More focused on specific deity

**Analysis**: This is significant! Black YV invokes Rudra for protection, while White YV dedicates the offering to Indra. This shows **different ritual emphases** between the traditions.

### 3. Textual Variations in Sanskrit

#### Opening Line
- **Black**: `इषे त्वोर्जे त्वा` (iṣe tvorje tvā)
- **White**: `इषे त्वा । ऊर्जे त्वा ।` (iṣe tvā | ūrje tvā |)
- **Difference**: White uses period (।) to separate, making it more staccato

#### "Winds" phrase
- **Black**: `वायवः स्थोपायवस्स्थ` (vāyavaḥ sthopāyavasstha) - "ye are winds, ye are approachers"
- **White**: `वायव स्थ` (vāyava stha) - "ye are breezes"
- **Difference**: Black is more elaborate, White is compressed

#### Benediction for cattle
- **Black**: Includes "Full of strength (ऊर्जस्वतीः), of milk (पयस्वतीः)" - specific blessings
- **White**: Omits these specific qualities, goes straight to "rich in offspring"

#### Protection formula
- **Black**: "Let no thief (स्तेन), no evil worker (अघशंस), have control"
- **Black adds**: "Let **Rudra's dart** (रुद्रस्य हेतिः) avoid you"
- **White**: "No thief (स्तेन), no evil-minded man (अघशंस) shall master you"
- **White omits**: The Rudra protection entirely

### 4. Ritual Purpose

Both mantras serve the **same ritual function**: blessing and protecting cattle at the beginning of a sacrifice.

**Common elements:**
- Invocation for food (iṣe) and strength (ūrje)
- Reference to winds/breezes (vāyu)
- Petition to Savitr
- Protection from thieves and evil forces
- Blessing for cattle and the sacrificer

**Different emphases:**
- Black: More protective (Rudra's weapons), more descriptive (strength, milk)
- White: More focused (dedicated to Indra), more economical

### 5. Translation Style

Both English translations capture the essence, but:

**Black translation:**
- Uses more line breaks
- More dramatic: "Let Rudra's dart avoid you"
- Slightly more formal: "Do thou protect"

**White translation:**
- More compressed formatting
- Direct address: "THEE for food" (capitals for emphasis)
- Slightly simpler: "Guard thou"

## Linguistic Analysis

### Shared Core (~80% similarity)

Both versions share the essential skeleton:
```
For food thee, for strength thee
Ye are winds/breezes
Savitr impel you to the best work
Swell [for the gods/for Indra]
Rich in offspring, free from sickness
Let no thief control you
Numerous with this lord of cattle
Protect the sacrificer's cattle
```

### Unique to Black YV (~20%):
- "ye are approachers" (upāyava)
- "full of strength, of milk" (ūrjasvat, payasvat)
- **"Let Rudra's dart avoid you"** (crucial protective formula)

### Unique to White YV:
- **"for Indra"** (explicit dedication)
- More punctuated, staccato style
- "Be constant" (dhruvā)

## Why This Opening Matters

This first mantra is **foundational** because:

1. **Sets the tone** for the entire sacrifice
2. **Blesses the cattle** who will be used/protected in the ritual
3. **Invokes key deities** (Savitr for impulsion, Rudra/Indra for power)
4. **Establishes protection** against malevolent forces

The differences in this opening mantra **perfectly encapsulate** the broader differences between the two traditions:
- Black YV: comprehensive, protective, descriptive
- White YV: essential, focused, economical

---

## Conclusion

Even in their very first words, the Black and White Yajurveda reveal themselves as **distinct literary and ritual traditions**.

While they share the same **core purpose and content** (blessing cattle for sacrifice), they express it through **different editorial philosophies**:

- **Black**: "Tell them everything, protect with all divine weapons"
- **White**: "Give them what they need to recite, keep it focused"

This opening comparison is the perfect microcosm of the 2,500+ verses that follow in each tradition.
