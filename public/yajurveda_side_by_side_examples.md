## Mythological Narrative: Black YV Only

### The Fish and Agni (Black YV 2.6.6)

**No White YV equivalent - this is pure Brahmana-style explanation:**

> Agni had three elder brothers; they perished while carrying the offering to the gods. Agni was afraid, 'Thus indeed will this one fall on misfortune.' He ran away, and entered the waters. The gods sought to start him up. The fish proclaimed him, and he cursed it, 'At Pleasure may they slay thee, since thou hast proclaimed me.' So they slay the fish at pleasure, for he is cursed. They found him; they said, 'Come to us, and carry the offering for us.' He said, 'Let me choose a boon; whatever of the offering when it is taken (in the ladle) falls outside the enclosing-sticks, let that be the share of my brothers.' Therefore whatever of the offering when it is taken falls outside the enclosing sticks is their share; verily by it he delights them...

This type of explanatory narrative is completely absent from White YV, which would present only the ritual formula without the myth.

---

## Theological Explanation: Black YV Only

### The Seventeenfold Prajapati (Black YV 1.6.11 excerpt)

**No White YV equivalent:**

> He who knows the seventeenfold Prajapati as connected with the sacrifice rests secure through the sacrifice, and falls not away from the sacrifice. 'Do thou proclaim' has four syllables; 'Be it proclaimed' has four syllables; 'Utter' has two syllables; 'We that do utter' has five syllables; the Vasat has two syllables; this is the seventeenfold Prajapati as connected with the sacrifice; he who knows thus rests secure through the sacrifice...
>
> The gods performed a sacrificial session; the quarters were dried up; they discerned this moist set of five; (with the words) 'Do thou proclaim', they produced the east wind; with 'Be it proclaimed', they caused the clouds to mass together; with 'Utter' they begat the lightning; with 'We that do sacrifice' they made rain to fall, and with the Vasat call they caused the thunder to roll...

This numerological-cosmological explanation with syllable counting is typical of Black YV's embedded Brahmana content.

---

## Unique White YV Content: Horse Sacrifice

### Anatomical-Cosmic Correspondences (White YV 25.1-25.2)

**No Black YV equivalent in core books:**

> I GRATIFY Fresh Grass with his teeth, Avakâ with his gums, Clay with his tooth-sockets, Tegas with his fangs. The tongue-tip for Sarasvatî; I gratify the root of the tongue and the palate with his neigh, Vâja with his jaws, the Waters with his mouth, the Stallion with his testicles, the Âdityas with the beard, Path with his eyebrows, Heaven and Earth with his eyelashes, Lightning with the pupils of his eyes...
>
> With his breath I gratify Vâta; with his outbreath the two Nostrils; with his lower lip the Upayâma; with his upper lip Existence. With his bright look I please Antara, with his reflection Bâhya; the Whirlpool with his head; Thunder with his frontal bone; the Lightning-flash with his brain; Lightning with the pupils of his eyes; Hearing with his external ears; Ears with his internal ears; Blood with his lower neck; Waters with the fleshless part of his neck...

This systematic mapping of horse anatomy to cosmic deities is unique to White YV Chapter 25.

---

## Unique White YV Content: Philosophy

### Isha Upanishad (White YV 40.1-40.3)

**No Black YV equivalent:**

> ENVELOPED by the Lord must be This All—each thing that moves on earth.
> With that renounced enjoy thyself. Covet no wealth of any man.
>
> One, only doing Karma here, should wish to live a hundred years.
> No way is there for thee but this. So Karma cleaveth not to man.
>
> Aye, to the Asuras belong those worlds enwrapt in blinding gloom.
> To them, when life on earth is done, depart the men who kill the Self.

The White YV concludes with philosophical Upanishadic teaching, while Black YV remains focused on ritual throughout.
