00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,560
Friends, in our last video we
learned about the Rig Veda. Of the four Vedas

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:10,080
From the oldest and most famous Vedas.
Oath proth is from Indra Ji's warrior energy

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,120
The Vedas laid the foundation of Indian culture.
Today we will discuss another Veda.

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,240
A Veda which, like the Rig Veda,
was not revealed in the sunlight but in the shadows of the night.

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,680
It was hidden in the Vedas. A Veda that
was not recognized as a real Veda for many centuries.

6
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,519
And a Veda that you will find
not on the battlefield of the Vedic period but in a mysterious

7
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:36,320
takes you deep into the jungle. Friends,
I welcome you to the mysterious

8
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,559
Atharvaveda.
Whenever the Vedas are discussed, people

9
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,040
The Atharva Veda is listed fourth in the list of the four Vedas . So, you might think so.

10
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:51,360
One might think that the Atharva Veda is the newest Veda.
But that's not the case. The truth is that there are thousands of

11
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:57,280
For years, there used to be only the Trai. Trai
means the three Vedas: Rigveda, Yajurveda,

12
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,399
The Samaveda and the Atharvaveda
were not considered part of this holy trinity. And when finally

13
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:08,320
The Atharva Veda's recognition
was met with considerable hesitation. But why?

14
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,200
This is because the knowledge in the Atharvaveda
is of a slightly different type.

15
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,000
It was dedicated to grand concepts.
For the growth of the kingdom, the kings and emperors

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,720
For blessings, for Soma Yagna,
Atharva Veda is not for such grand things

17
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,520
It was about people like you and me,
common people and their common problems.

18
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,880
To avoid illness, to cure snake venom, to
defeat enemies, to make someone your own

19
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,680
Falling in love, protecting children,
peace in the home. All of the things that a Vedic

20
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,400
People who care about themselves
may be due to their practical nature .

21
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,799
The Atharva Veda did not receive as much respect as the other three Vedas .

22
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,600
The Atharva Veda contains not only such spells
but also some deep philosophies. Some of the

23
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:57,040
Most Profound Upanishads Like The Mundaka
Upanishad, Mandukya Upanishad, Prashna Upanishad

24
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,759
All of this is connected to the Atharva Veda. And most
interestingly, through the Atharva Veda, we

25
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,719
There is much to learn about our ancient history
. Who was this sage Atharva?

26
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:12,000
What connection did he have with Iran? And
why do we hear echoes of Indra in the Atharva Veda?

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,440
Instead, we find a more subtle presence of Varuna.
Let's explore this mysterious passage from the Atharva Veda.

28
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:23,520
On a jungle safari. Do you know what
Atharva Veda is all about? Let's begin.

The lines you just heard That was a love
chat used to make someone fall in love with you

39
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:24,480
The mantra comes from the sixth chapter of the Atharvaveda, one
of the 20 chapters into which the Atharvaveda is divided.

40
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,640
Two versions of the Atharvaveda survive today. One is Shaunaka

41
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,840
version and a Papla version. At one time,
there were nine such versions in total. Each one of

42
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,400
them corresponding to a particular branch.
Shanak is the standard one which continuously

43
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,879
It's been going on. And
that's what we'll use as a reference in this video today. The Other Version

44
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:47,920
It is called Pipla Adar version which
was found in Kashmir for the first time in 1873.

45
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,400
Unfortunately, it was in a corrupt state
. Then, surprisingly, in 1953

46
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,120
Entomologist Durga Mohan Bhattacharya
found Pipla in a village in Odisha.

47
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,879
A fully intact
manuscript of the tradition. It includes the Shaunaka version

48
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:05,760
There are more mantras. And scholars have been
comparing the two versions to provide new insights.

49
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,519
Discovering. The first thing you'll
notice about the Other Veda is that it's nothing

50
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,840
Things are very strange. Some mantras
are three lines long, while others are two lines long.

51
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,400
Some are just one line prose
. Some have a longer first line, so

52
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,320
The next one is short. The ending is also dry,
with each mantra consisting of just two words.

53
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,160
Based on the language used of the
Atharvaveda, scholars believe that some parts of

54
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,360
The Atharvaveda could actually be even older than
the Rigveda. The 20 cantos of the Atharvaveda are divided into four

55
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,919
It is divided into layers. Books
1 to 7 are called the early layers.

56
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:40,720
This is the Age of Magic, when some
mysterious spells were popular. Since the 8th century

57
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,360
The 12th chapter
is called the middle layer. This is the edge of the mind. When the Atharvaveda

58
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,639
Philosophy was most developed in
the 13th to 18th centuries .

59
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,639
is said. This is the age where most of
the Hindu rituals from funeral to

60
00:04:54,639 --> 00:05:00,400
Marriage they got formulated. And the last two
books, 19 and 20, are the appendix layers.

61
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,120
in which verses from the Rig Veda were kind of
adopted into the Atharva Veda. It's like a

62
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,240
covered to make the Atharva Veda more acceptable to
the thought leaders of that time.

63
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,000
use the terms early, middle, and late,
it may seem like this is purely a

64
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,479
Chronological ordering. But this
is not exactly correct. I have analyzed the 20 cantos of the Atharvaveda.

65
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,639
The hymns of the Vedas are arranged vertically,
with the number of mantras in each hymn being

66
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:27,759
The darker and taller it becomes. We see
that almost all the books in the early

67
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,919
The layers are arranged in an ascending order of
mantra count. Here the mantras are

68
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:36,560
Relatively short and quite simple.
If you look at the middle and late layers, then notice

69
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:42,160
How they are significantly darker. Meaning,
there are a lot of mantras, but every

70
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,919
Soap. It is very different from the initial
layer. And finally comes the appendix.

71
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:50,800
It was stuffed with a lot of insulation
. Now we'll go layer by layer and

72
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,360
Let's see exactly what
's going on in each layer. Part One: The Early Layers. When people

73
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,280
Let 's talk about the spooky nature of the Atharvaveda.
It is mostly this layer that

74
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,840
They are talking about this. This is the layer of
magic that separates the Atharva Veda from the rest of the Vedas.

75
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,560
Compare makes it quite unique. Like
a pharmacist to cure diseases

76
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,600
mantras, Ayushyani mantras for long life
and nourishing mantras for happiness and prosperity.

77
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:19,759
Of course the infamous Aachar Mantra i.e. extreme
black magic through which you can control someone very much.

78
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,080
You can also cause harm. Fortunately,
there are also protective spells that you can use on others.

79
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,800
You can avoid people's magical spells.
And beyond these, we also find spells for

80
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,520
Daily regular use. For example, how can you win at gambling ? You're safe while traveling.

81
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,600
How can you survive? How can you protect yourself with amulets ? All such

82
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,520
There are also many prayers for fulfilling wishes
. People believe that

83
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,840
The mantras of the Atharva Veda
have some inherent magical quality.

84
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:51,360
What they mean is different but simply these
sounds and vibrations have a magical power.

85
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,240
It's kind of like an ancient form
of manifestation that you can use through mantras.

86
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,720
You can literally bend reality by
... I guess you might be feeling how this is

87
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,039
Kind of connected to Tantra and your
intuition would be right.

88
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:10,720
Going beyond the layer we
find many gems like Ayurveda Tantra and Shaivika Agamas.

89
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,440
There for the Atharva Veda is a mirror
of the concerns of everyday society of the Vedic period.

90
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:20,560
Of priorities. A society where there
were no doctors or police. So this is that.

91
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,960
The time of the society when language
was developing to describe order and care.

92
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,520
The Atharvaveda has historically been referred to by many names . From Amritveda to

93
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:35,440
Atma Veda, Angira Veda, Brahma Veda, Atharva
Veda, Angi Rasa Veda, Bhargava Rasa Veda, Kshatriya

94
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:40,000
Veda, Chandoveda. There's a story behind each name
. But let's just focus on two of them.

95
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,280
Dees, Atharvasa and Bhargava Angarsa. All these
words refer to three Rishi families.

96
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:51,280
Atharvas who come from sage Atharva. Angirasas
who come from the sage Angira and Bhargavaz

97
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:56,879
Come from the sage Bhrigo. These three sage families
seemed to be there even before the Rigveda was

98
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,440
composed. Because in the Rigveda itself they
are referred to as ancestors.

99
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:06,319
The interesting thing is that all three
of these names have a connection to fire.

100
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:12,240
The word is linked to fire or embers
. The word Atharvan may have come from Atar.

101
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,199
Which is an Iranian word for fire. And
brigu comes from the root word brik meaning

102
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:22,160
A spark. So, realistically, it seems that
these names are used to refer to fire.

103
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:27,039
Priests who may have lived before the creation of the Vedas
. Ten evidences to show that these three

104
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:31,520
Atharva would be the oldest of the names.
The oldest mandalas of the Rigveda, i.e., the sixth

105
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,800
The Mandala states that the sages
used to churn fire like the Atharvas in ancient times.

106
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,839
Even the Mundaka Upanishad, which is linked
to the Atharva Veda, begins with a

107
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,480
With the story. Brahma Ji, the creator of all
and the sustainer of the world, emerges

108
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,360
He is the first God. He gives Brahma Vidya which
is the basis of all sciences to his son

109
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:59,160
They pass to the Atharvan. Brahma is
the firstborn of the gods

110
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:10,640
The creator of the universe, the building, the cow,
all Brahma, knowledge, all knowledge, reputation

111
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:19,120
Atharva to his eldest son Pra
then Atharva gave this knowledge to the sage Angiras

112
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,160
So essentially
according to the Mundaka Upanishad, the Atharvas came first and

113
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,800
Then the Angiras might have followed later.
The Atharvas are also described in the Chulaka Upanishad.

114
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,800
It is said to be the ancestors of the Pragus. By
the way, it is also in the Zoroastrian religion of Iran.

115
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:38,640
Their priests
were called Atharvas or Atharvas. Meaning at a time when India and

116
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,440
The people of Iran used to be one, so their common
priests might have been called Atharvas.

117
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,680
The texts also indicate that the
first layer is Bheshagam, meaning happiness and peace.

118
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:52,160
The mantras of
were developed by the clan of sage Bhrigu. While those of black magic

119
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,640
Components were developed by the
clan of sage Angiras. Since the name is Bhargava

120
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:02,000
Angarsa is described in the Atharvaveda as an
alloy which is a black magic metal and a white

121
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,519
Made of magic metal.

129
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:06,480
Let us now move
to the second layer of the Atharvaveda, from Books 8 to Books 12, which is called the Age of

130
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,120
Mind will say here the sages of Atharvaveda are less into magic
spells and mysteries of the universe

131
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:16,079
For example, in the 10th chapter
we get Skambhasu the Him of

132
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:20,959
The Cosmic Pillar. The sage is asking
what is this invisible pillar that holds this entire universe together.

133
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:25,839
What holds up the universe? What does the Earth
rest on and what supports the sky?

134
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:34,720
Is it? Kasminange

00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:11,760
Who knows the Ad Veda before the creation
where the Rig Veda was fascinated by what of the world

143
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:16,720
Tha Otherway Seems to Be More Interested in the
How of Things Then in the Ninth Chapter We

144
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:22,800
It is found in Kamasukta, The Hem of Desire. Here it
is said that desire came first.

145
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:28,240
Rahe Ho Na Kamna first came before For the
Gods, before the Ancestors and before even

146
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:33,839
Human desire created the universe
. That might almost seem blasphemous.

147
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:39,200
To people today. Where not having desires
is the most vicious value. And then the 12th

148
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:44,079
In the Sukta we find the Bhumis. And
historian Meenakshi Jain even says that

149
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:49,200
The Bhumi Sukta could very well be the first
anthem of humanity. Atharva Veda. Atharva Veda

150
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:54,720
There is a Sukhata in me. It is called Prithvi
Sukhata. And historians say that my

151
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,680
It doesn't have to be said. It is called the First National
Song of the World.

152
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,279
Asmato
[Music]

153
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:11,279
Humans
whose or mountains are equal

154
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:16,720
Nana Viriya Aushadhiya
Vivarti

155
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:26,320
In the Prithvi Na Prathata Ram Na Prithvi Sukta,
the Earth repeatedly says, "Cut me."

156
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:33,200
No, don't share me. I'm like a cow
. I'll milk you whenever you want to wash me.

157
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:40,639
I will give it. She repeatedly says that
all the people who live above me are theirs.

158
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:47,279
Their speech is different. Their clothing is different. Their
food is different. But I treat them all equally.

159
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:51,519
This is where we get the phrase "mother land "

160
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:57,519
Putro aham prithvi matlab earth is my mother
and I am her son ok remember this

161
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:02,440
We heard a song at the start of the segment.

162
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,800
There, too, the question was, "
How is this world made? How does it stand? Guess what?"

163
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:20,399
That was actually a mantra from the
Holy Book of the Zoroastrians. Yes,

164
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:26,079
Avesta. Well, technically the Persian translation
of Avesta, which is actually Vedic Sanskrit.

165
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:31,120
but both these texts are thousands of years and thousands of kilometers apart.

166
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,839
were taken away. So
why do so many of these questions have a common thread? Was this just a

167
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,120
Coincidence?
Coincidence? I think not.

168
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,440
In the previous video we learned how Rigveda
is primarily a document of the Angarsa clan.

169
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,880
Top 10 Rishi Clans include Kanva Rishi, Gautama
Rishi, Bhardwaj Rishi, Gritsamada Rishi and

170
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:54,160
Vamadeva. These are all Angaras sub clans
which makes the contribution of the overall

171
00:14:54,160 --> 00:15:00,079
The Angaras clan is about 50% of the Rig Veda,
so they are very much the main characters.

172
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:06,000
The Angaras worshipped the gods, whose
chief was Indra. And as you know, Indra would

173
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,360
Represents desire
. Represents action

174
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,519
They do. Indra doesn't follow anyone's rules
. He makes his own. If

175
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:18,639
Indra ji is called Gandhi ji, O Indra
there is enough for everyone, need not for

176
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:23,519
Everyone's greed. So Indra says to him,
"Oh, how cute? Go tell this to the demons."

177
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,199
Say it. Gandhiji, it is because of my greed that
your needs are being fulfilled.

178
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:32,240
Desire is good. Power is good. This is kind
of like what Niebuhr and Plato discuss about.

179
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:37,120
Justice in the Greek culture.
According to Plato, justice is doing good and

180
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:42,079
Being part of the natural order. When every human being
understands their responsibility in society,

181
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:47,519
If he performs his
duties properly, he establishes justice in society overall.

182
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:51,440
He
thinks that this is just a social

183
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:56,160
Constructs. What weak people create to control stronger people . Which is true

184
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,560
I am powerful, I do whatever I want without anyone's permission.

185
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:05,040
Ask for it. Look, the Vedas are completely self-
aware that Indra has many flaws.

186
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,199
They know Indra is jealous,
violent, and lustful. He's always

187
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:14,720
He is engrossed in it. And yet, Angaras
can never tire of singing Indra's praises. Why? Because

188
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:20,000
Despite all his faults, Indra gets the job
done. He helps you win wars. He helps

189
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,120
You become powerful. Atharva Veda 7.5.8 says
that in my right hand are my winnings.

190
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:31,600
And in my left hand is my victory. Indra,
give me cows, horses, wealth, and gold. So,

191
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,639
Indira is kind of like a lucky charmer
who helps with gambling. Look, Angras people.

192
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,480
If he were at Hogwards, he
would probably be part of the Gryffindor house.

193
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,040
The adventurous ones. They
weren't afraid to break the rules. And they are kind of

194
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:49,680
Like the Greeks in some ways with whom they
share this Indo-European madness.

195
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,600
In fact, there are many
religious parallels between Greece and India.

196
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,000
Was this whole thing of the younger gods
replacing the older gods? The Olympians

197
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,839
Replacing the Titans. In the Indian
context, we also had Dawatas.

198
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:06,880
Replacing the Asuras. The new replacing
the old. The other Greek gods have a lot of

199
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:12,079
Logos, Zeus, Aries, Apollo. We see these
men as powerful, passionate, and lustful.

200
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:16,319
Some cheat, some drink alcohol
. These people celebrate the joys of life.

201
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:20,400
And it seems like they're not
just tolerated for their floss, but more so

202
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:25,280
They are loved because of their flaws. Possibly
because it made them relatable. Also India

203
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,120
Both Greek and Roman cultures
are very visual cultures.

204
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,440
Concrete forms are given
in the form of icons. Regarding Greek statues,

205
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,080
You know. And Indian architecture.
And the more I read about it,

206
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,760
It seems to me that they
don't see the world in black and white.

207
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:46,880
The world is a spectrum. And every
creature is like a mongoose. It has a type.

208
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,559
There's a weight, there's a height. Everything
has a personality, a

209
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:55,120
Personification happens. So,
they seem to be more open to this kind of diversity.

210
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,919
The Angres family's patron deity was
Brihaspati. Represented by Jupiter.

211
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:04,640
He was the chief priest of the gods who provided strategic counsel to Indra in their

212
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,760
Wars Against the Asuras. And who
can tell me who the Patron of the Asuras is?

213
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:16,320
Shukracharya, that's right. And
who was Shukracharya's father? Oh my God. Sage Pragu.

214
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:21,679
The pattern is clear. The sage Angas
was a leader of the Vedic civilization.

215
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:28,000
Closer to the Indo-European culture, there
was another lineage that shaped Vedic culture.

216
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,880
The griffins of Angirasce represent this culture in contrast to Dorian
adventurism .

217
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:38,480
The Raven Clones were stable in 1990. They
worshipped the Old Gods in a formless state.

218
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:43,840
He preferred order to will,
purity to power, and polytheism to

219
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:49,840
Instead of monotheism, this tradition was followed
by the Bhrigus, the top two authors of the Atharva Veda.

220
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:55,200
The sages are Atharvas and Bhrigus. Notice
that the Rigveda ranks lowest in the list.

221
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:00,240
While the Rigveda is dominated by the Angirasa Rishis , the Atharvaveda

222
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,559
Bhrigu dominates energy. Vaise is
much more cultural in Angiras and Bhrigu

223
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:08,720
Differences are what we shall talk about, but the
fundamental difference is what defines all the rest.

224
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,880
Differences arise. Seem to be
about their thoughts about the afterlife.

225
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,520
What happens after death? In Vedic times,
after the afterlife, the soul took two highways.

226
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:23,760
One was Devayana, meaning the paths
of the gods, and the other was Pitriyana, meaning the path of the

227
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:28,640
Ancestors. Devayana went directly to
Brahmaloka, after which one attained salvation.

228
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,760
This was the recommended path that the British
strove to achieve.

229
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:39,280
The path is also called Uttarayan.
In Pitayana the soul goes only to the moon world, from where

230
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:44,320
It makes a U-turn and respawns back
on Earth. One path is for the gods, and the other is for the

231
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:50,240
of the ancestors. And it seems like the Angarases
and Bhrigus had their own favourites. Bhrigu who

232
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:55,919
They were paternal followers and practiced ancestor worship
. In the Mahabharata, the Devas were considered the younger sons of the Asuras.

233
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,840
Bhai has been said, which symbolically
implies that Asuras were the Older Gods.

234
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:04,720
Sage Bhrigu used to offer sacrifices to both gods and demons . But for him

235
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:10,000
The most prominent demon was Varuna Deva. You can imagine
that he was equally loved by the Bhargavas.

236
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,200
Angiras had as many Indras, or perhaps even
more. For example, the fourth Mandala of the Rigveda

237
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:21,200
I say, "I am King Varuna. I
have been given demonic powers."

238
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:26,240
Even the gods will agree. I am the king of all humans
. According to the Atreya Brahman

239
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:32,559
Bhrigu himself got the title of Varuni,
that is, the son of Varuna. Where Indra Ji Will

240
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:37,280
While Lord Varuna is
the god of cosmic order, i.e., night.

241
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:41,840
From an outside perspective, nighttime sleep is self-regulated. It
operates at its own pace. It is governed by one's desires.

242
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:46,880
Not from. So you cannot change the results of your actions by coaxing any God .

243
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:51,679
Order and harmony are automatically maintained through the seasons .

244
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:57,919
To do so means to follow Dharma. This is what
protects life. So Varuna is the Plato.

245
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:02,880
Varuna is now
considered a boring ocean god after the Puranic reshuffle .

246
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,120
Like the Greek Positon, but
in the Rig Veda, Varuna seems to be the ultimate sky.

247
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:12,480
The god worshipped by the Aryans after Dasa and before Indra . In the Rigveda

248
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:17,120
Varun ji has received a lot of praise. For
example, a mantra says, Varun ji

249
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:21,120
I can see the trajectory of birds flying in the sky .

250
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:26,240
The ship's path is also known
. It also shows which way the wind will blow.

251
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:31,679
Varun knows what
is and what will happen. In fact, our former

252
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:36,159
President APJ Abdul Kalam
while launching his book Wings of Fire

253
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:42,720
A mantra from the Atharva Veda was used
.

254
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:49,679
Uto samudro varunas gukshi utasmin alp
udake neelin, that is, this earth belongs to Varuna.

255
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:55,200
This limitless sky is His. This water
is also contained within Him. And yet He is in this water.

256
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:00,080
hidden in even a drop of water.
I love this just previous mantra. It says

257
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:05,039
Whether you're standing still, walking, or
hiding somewhere. Whenever two people think they're

258
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:10,320
When they are talking privately, Varun
is present between them as a third witness who

259
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:15,120
The One who sees everything knows everything
. Indra doesn't seem to care much.

260
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:19,919
About sin, virtue, and all that. But
this is not the case with Varuna. In the Rigveda

261
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:24,320
While writing some of the funeral suktas
the sage seemed to be scared of Varuna.

262
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:30,400
For example, it is said in Rigveda 7864, O
Varun Dev, what mistake have I committed that

263
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:35,600
You took away my friend who
used to sing your praises, tell me Lord, take away my sins.

264
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:41,280
Take and then there is Rigveda 786 six
in this mantra we know Varuna hum pe kin

265
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:46,240
We impose restrictions on things, it means we
will not harm ourselves as much as

266
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:53,440
Seduction, thoughtlessness, alcohol, gambling and anger
will do, so you see the contrast, Indra on one side

267
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,400
is being worshipped for helping in gambling
and on the other hand it is being said that Varun

268
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:03,280
Dev, we will not indulge in alcohol, gambling, or anger
. Varun ji was also the

269
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:10,240
The ultimate judge. Atharva Veda 1.10.2 says,
I offer my obeisances to King Varuna,

270
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:16,159
His anger, his fierceness that
tests every lie. O Varuna, I am yours

271
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:21,039
And I have been bringing thousands of people.
Bless your servant to live for 100 years.

272
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:26,159
Notice how the Vedic mantras start taking
a devotional-like property. Varuna is seen as a

273
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:31,360
Omniscient, omnipresent, a silent watcher.
Where Indra acts, Varuna

274
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:36,320
Observe. Where Indra concurs
, Varuna judges. Where Indra

275
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,640
Varuna is the god of warriors, while Varuna
is the god of priests and kings.

276
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:46,080
It is often associated with imagery of a flame burning underwater .

277
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:52,000
At some places he is also called the Apam
Napath which means the nephew. and nephew of the

278
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,919
Water's either of them. So this fire inside the
water, it gives a strange kind of wipe.

279
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:02,880
It's like an internally subdued kind of
fire. This could also be because Bhrigu seems to

280
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:08,159
Be coast loving people. There
is a town in Gujarat called Bharuch. In ancient times it was called Bhriguk

281
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:12,880
It was also called Kutch, which literally means
Bhrigu's marshland. This town is situated on the banks of the Narmada.

282
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:17,919
Located at the opening of the river, it
would have been a very easy place to trade.

283
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:22,559
In the Puranas, Goddess Lakshmi
is said to be the daughter of sage Bhrigu. Evidenced by Her

284
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:28,559
Alternative names are Bhargavi and Bhrigu's Daughter.
This suggests a possible connection to the Bhrigus.

285
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:33,840
It could also be due to wealth and trade. Think
of the merchant navy of that time. So, this location

286
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:38,960
used to expose the Bhrigus to other
cultures including Asaria, Acadia,

287
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:44,400
In Babylon, Iran, Arabia, these cultures
followed Semitic culture, not Indo-European.

288
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,720
which is also a language
family to which Hebrew, Aramaic, Arabic

289
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,039
This all belongs to. By the way, I also
find it fascinating that the capital of Assyria

290
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:58,320
The Asura. Where people worshipped the Asura.
Who was one of the many gods of the beginning

291
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:02,400
The impact of this cultural exchange
can still be seen in India today.

292
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:08,559
You get it through practices like illusion.
You know that sound which women make, called

293
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:13,760
Also called hulhuli or uruli, it's
a distinctly Sumerian practice.

294
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:18,559
This tradition is still alive today, from the East to the coastal regions of India .

295
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:23,520
Families eventually
made the Gangetic heartland their stronghold. They settled in regions like

296
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:28,400
Hastinapur and Kurukshetra and even
expanded in words. Brugus but border

297
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:33,440
They lived in areas like Gujarat.
According to the Puranas, Bhrigu had two sons. One was

298
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:39,039
Venus,
named after Friday, was also the Guru of the

299
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:44,400
Asuras and he was the master of the Sanjivani
Vidya. The other was Chavanji. Yes, the same.

300
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:49,760
The cow who invented Chavanprash. He was the great grandfather
of sages Jamadagni and Parashurama.

301
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:54,640
So Bhagus Were a Pretty Big Deal and Notice
How Bhagus Stungly Associated with Healing

302
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,960
This is being done with all these herb
preferences. This will later become the basis of Ayurveda and

303
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,799
Unani medicine
is transformed into systems. Look if you look at the culturists

304
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:06,799
Observe, you will see that humans
create their own gods in their own lives.

305
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:12,159
When humans conceive a form for gods
, they often project their own ideals

306
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:16,320
On to their gods. The trades they
value in themselves are the trades they value in themselves.

307
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:21,520
They also search among the gods. The beetles
had a great fondness for wisdom. Varuna

308
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:26,480
is described in many instances as the God who possesses Vice or Wisdom.

309
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:31,840
For example, Rigveda 7.87.4 refers to Varuna as a scholar. Other contexts

310
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:36,400
In it is the link to the word Vedas which
also means wisdom. Now guys, it's time

311
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,880
For the big reveal. The moment that this entire
video was building up toward. Author

312
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,760
Jitendra Chatterjee writes in his book Atharva Zathustra that this word is found in the Vedas eventually.

313
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:52,400
would have led to a term like medhas also
meaning intelligence. So asura methas which

314
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:58,559
Eventually Becomes Ahura Masta
Zoroastrianism's Most Supreme Formless

315
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:04,320
God. So Aurasta is none other than our own
Varuna Deva. Okay, if that seems too

316
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:09,120
Indirect and convoluted consider that
Zoroastrian text Kharada state in the

317
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:15,039
List that describes 101 names of Ahura Mazda . Check out What's Your 44 Name

318
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:17,919


319
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:25,600


320
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:31,360
Oh my God that means the Supreme God of Iran
is none other than Varun Dev of India.

321
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,720
In the last video, we saw
how Hinduism has many gods.

322
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:39,760
It seems like a similar
assimilation happened here. Varuna of the Aryans

323
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:44,480
God Who Was Mofad on the Indo-European
Uranus Assimilates into the Semitic God

324
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:49,600
Asura Creating the First of Its Kind
Monotheistic God Ahura Masta The Base of

325
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,840
What Would Later Become the God of the Entire
Abrahamic World, But We Are Getting to Ahead

326
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:59,520
Of Ourselves. Part Three Late Stage. The
Late Stage of the Other Veda is Talking About a

327
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:04,480
The time when the divorce of Indo-Iranian cultures
was finalized. Now there was a common culture.

328
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,880
had gone in separate directions.
After deliberating at the Edge of Mind ,

329
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,679
This is a society based on ideals and
on the basis of those ideals it tries to mould its societies.

330
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:18,640
For example, between books 13 and 18,
there are three books which said the foundation.

331
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:23,840
of the Hindu culture. Book 14 is completely
dedicated to marriage-related rituals. Today

332
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:28,799
The backbone of all those mantras comes

333
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:33,440
From this part of the Atharva Veda. Book 18
discusses another aspect of life, namely, Antyeshti.

334
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:38,720
Funeral rituals are described. So these
two books solidify two very important

335
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:43,760
Aspects of any human's life. But very
interestingly, Book 15 is called The Vratya

336
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:48,399
Kand. This entire Kand is dedicated to
this vrat character. Represents a person

337
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:54,080
Who is having matted hair who goes into a
trans while dancing. And that society's

338
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:59,360
Almost stays outside. Seeming like a non-
Vedic yogi. Well, guys, this is the beginning.

339
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:03,760
Of the process of absorption of Rudra.
This is the description of a proto Shiva

340
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:08,000
character. From here we see that
the process of Aryan religion had begun.

341
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,399
A complete transformation into Hinduism, or Sanatana Dharma . Parallel Around

342
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:17,760
12 BC A Hotri, or
a Joutar, appears in Iranian religion. Called Patriarch

343
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:22,399
Zarathustra. His name probably meant a
golden camel. In English it is called

344
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:27,279
Zoroaster. At the age of 30, Zoroaster
receives a divine vision.

345
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:31,600
Ahura Mazdar himself contacts them directly
and appoints his messenger.

346
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:36,559
He continued to propagate this new religion under the patronage of King Vishtaspa until his death.

347
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:41,039
They set about establishing it. Their
central message is humata, hukta,

348
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:46,799
Huwashta means good thoughts, good words, and
good deeds. Follow these three things and

349
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:51,679
Ahora Mastada will give you salvation.
But the true radical reform of Zarathustra

350
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:55,679
Monotheism is the way of preaching.
In Iran and Arabia before Zoroaster

351
00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:00,960
Many gods were worshipped, for
example, the Semitic sky god Elom-Hobal.

352
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,679
Ishtar. Zoroaster divided these multiple gods
with different qualities into just two.

353
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:11,360
Distilled into archetypes:
Ahramasta the Good and Angrahamanu the Evil.

354
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:16,559
In Yasna 32 Zarathustra says, "All you gods
give birth to evil thoughts. Lies and

355
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:21,200
You have been corrupted by your ego. The people who
do the most evil things are the ones

356
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,279
They become your favorites. Do you understand? So Zarathustra: Here is directly

357
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:30,559
Addressing how Indra, Agni, Vayu are all
problematic because they incentivize

358
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:35,679
Bad behavior. No wonder he was super pist
of our Vedic Rishis the Angarasas. Possibly

359
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:40,240
Which is why Angramanyu might be
connected with Angarsa. He professed monotheism

360
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:45,200
caste, system,
exclusive, a priest, class

361
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,840
Removed all concepts and
made the religion more accessible. Animal Sacrifice

362
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:54,159
It was completely banned.
The concept of yajna was fading away in India.

363
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:58,159
In favor of this new cool thing called
meditation. But Zoroaster in Parsheia

364
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:02,159
They made fire worship a central
part of their religion. You don't know this about the Baha'is.

365
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:06,720
Do you know? Yes, the same Lotus Temple
religion. I didn't believe in their religion.

366
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,559
It is said that God has progressively revealed
himself to humanity. First Age

367
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:16,399
Abraham then Krishna then Moses then
Zoroaster then Buddha Christ and Prophet

368
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:21,760
Muhammad and his two priests followed him
. So, from their perspective, Zoroaster

369
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:26,240
Reformed Indo-Iranian culture in the same way as Krishna did.

370
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,600
Directly from Zoroastrianism

371
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:34,399
It was influenced by Judaism,
the religion of Jesus. Concepts like one supreme God,

372
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:39,760
Good versus evil, heaven versus hell,
all this Zoroastrianism gave to Judaism

373
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,600
From Judaism, these ideas then
passed into Christianity. And finally

374
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:48,960
Islam
probably adopted monotheism or tawhid as its core principle from Christianity.

375
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:56,559
fundamental. I have come to believe
that Islam is a very very very very very

376
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:00,960
Strictly monotheistic face.
Many of Islam's concepts are based in

377
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:06,240
Jordanism and very interestingly both
religions have a bridge described which

378
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:11,519
connects the human realm
with heaven. Both religions believe that

379
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:16,640
For believers, this bridge widens
and becomes easier to cross.

380
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:22,399
And for those who have had scenes with non-believers,
it's a razor's edge.

381
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:26,799
As thin as it gets. Making it
impossible for you to cross and fall off inu

382
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:31,840
The Zoroastrians know this bridge
as Chinvat Peretu. While in Islam

383
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:38,159
This is the Bridge of Sirat Reference in One of
the Mostant Surat in Islam. Suratul Fatiha

384
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:44,200
Iya nabad wa Iya nastaeen

385
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:49,640
Ina Sirat Mustaqeem

386
00:32:49,919 --> 00:33:00,440
Sirat Lazna An Al Gair Mag Alai One

387
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:07,200
In India, the story took a slightly different direction.
Varun's spirit doesn't exist here.

388
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,279
It was transmuted into classical Indian fashion .

389
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:16,480
Medha Tithi Rishi of the clan has
mentioned in the Atharvaveda that Vishnu and Varuna are worshipped together.

390
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:21,200
Write the mantra. Atharva Veda 7.25.1,
for example, says this in the morning

391
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:26,080
I pray to Vishnu and Varuna
, gods whose power no one can match.

392
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:32,320
You two are the most powerful and
foremost among the mighty. Even Indra and Vishnu

393
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:36,960
Added together by sage Praskhandvara in Atharvaveda
7.44.1

394
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:42,640
Wrote. I mean composed. Indra and Vishnu,
you both conquered. Never defeated.

395
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:48,320
O Indra and Vishnu, when you
fought your battle, this entire infinite world with its

396
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:52,720
Three zones were created. Slowly and
gradually, Varun ji's qualities

397
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:57,039
Largely, Vishnu shifted to Vishnu.
Visually, for example, Vishnu in the Vedas.

398
00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:01,600
was described as a short Vamana form,
but later Varuna's majestic form

399
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:07,519
The imagery, that cosmic vastness, that all-seeing
nature, the blue skin, the ocean symbolism, it all adds up

400
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:11,440
Bhrigu, who had been a devotee of Varuna, became Vishnu's devotees.

401
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:15,520
He began to transform into a devotee. This
story is famously captured in the mythology.

402
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:20,240
Story where Rishi Bhrigu tries to test who
among the three Tridevs will be the first in the yajna

403
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:24,960
Who should be worshipped? Bhrigu went
to Brahma, but he was engrossed in meditation.

404
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:29,679
They are. So, out of ego, they reject him
. Then he goes to Shiva.

405
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:34,240
But he's probably angry and busy
. So he rejects him as well. Then when

406
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:38,480
He goes to Lord Vishnu, who
is resting on Sheshnag.

407
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:43,520
When he did not get up, he became angry and
kicked Vishnu in the chest.

408
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:48,320
He does not get angry. Instead , pressing the feet of sage Bhrigu, he says, O sage, your

409
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,919
Are your legs hurting? Bhrigu ji
melts away and accepts him. This is

410
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:57,280
Because he saw Varuna's qualities in Vishnu , such as kindness, humility, and good will.

411
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:02,880
Words, wisdom. Where Vishnu took over the
icon from Varuna. Shiva is increasing

412
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:07,680
Worshipped in an iconic form. The
God who represents the Nirguna, the

413
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:13,280
Formless. No wonder Advaita philosophy naturally
aligns with Shaivism. Shaivism also

414
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,280
Absorbed a lot of the antiquated
properties of this time. Which gave birth

415
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:22,160
To later movements like the Nath sect or
Lingayatism, where caste is actively

416
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:27,359
Challenged. In fact, the Bhargava's
later sages, such as Parashurama and Shiva,

417
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:32,720
He was a great devotee of Varuna. So it seems like the
same archetype of the wrath holder Varuna

418
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:36,880
He received very different
treatment in India and Iran.

419
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:42,480
Masculine aspects
were extracted to form Ahmasta. While the feminine

420
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:47,599
Aspects were distilled to Anahita the
Goddess of Water, who is probably Semitic

421
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:52,560
There may have been influence from Ishtar. There was
a goddess called Mithra who lived in some areas of Iran.

422
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:57,760
He was super popular in
India and he was regarded as the God of Contracts.

423
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:02,240
Varun's feminine aspects
were preserved. And even he was

424
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:07,680
Paired with Mitra. 88% of the
times Mitra and Varuna are listed in the Rigveda

425
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:11,839
Together. And the Puranas and their
postmodernist twist that Varun and Mitra have

426
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:16,880
Sort of like lovers. They are
compared to two half moons. Which is the waxing moon

427
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,800
It means the waxing moon
is represented by Neptune and

428
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:25,599
The waning moon
is represented by Mitra. Bhagavata Purana

429
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:31,280
In this, Varun and Mitra are said to have given
birth to Rishi Vashisht and Rishi Agastya through

430
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:37,280
An Asexual Process. Varuna as
Ara Mazda in Europe Shaped How Folk Saw God the Father

431
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:42,560
But Mitra became a full-blown cult called
Mitra. A Roman religion before Christianity

432
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:46,880
The major military region was Mitrism. This was
kind of like a secret brotherhood.

433
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:51,040
There used to be underground meeting places
that looked like caves and they called them

434
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:56,320
Mitriums. And these
were springing up all over the place where soldiers would meet and socialize.

435
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:01,200
In fact, it is believed
that Mitra's birthday was on December 25th.

436
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:06,079
A thing that turns out to be Jesus Christ
's birthday, according to a Bible story.

437
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:11,040
The night baby Jesus was born, he
was visited by three messengers bearing gifts.

438
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:17,200
They are called Magi. Magi was the term
used in Western Iran for Zor Astridians.

439
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:22,079
Priests. This term comes from the Old
Iranian word magupati which means something

440
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:26,560
Like the God of Maya. This is
also where we get terms like magic and magician.

441
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:30,640
Interestingly, a community
of Brahmins also exists in India called Maga.

442
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:34,880
The Brahmans trace their lineage to these Iranian priests.

443
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:39,040
The last two books of the Atharvaveda
are almost copy-pasted from the Rigveda.

444
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:44,160
All the Asuraic Bhrigu related text. You
can imagine Angaras Pandit a little bit atharvaveda

445
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:48,880
Hence the heavy dose of Indira devotion injected into the last two episodes.

446
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:53,839
But, as you can probably agree,
the Atharva Veda has a different vibe. It is about those Bhrigu

447
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:59,520
Kaa Energy is the OG Skeptical Stoic
Purity Focused Ancestor Washing

448
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:04,000
Mercantiles were formless God loving people.
Who gave the whole world the blessings of Varun Dev

449
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,800
Varun Dev or
Ahmasta is the best template for all the

450
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:13,280
Gods in most of Asia and Europe. Whether
you call him Vishnu or Krishna or

451
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:18,640
Christ or Allah or Shiva. You
call it the same all-judging, all-knowing Father of humanity.

452
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:22,560
You're worshipping. Westerners
call India a morganically pagan nation. This comes.

453
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:27,359
From the Latin word paganos literally meaning
villagers or rustics. Islam in its pre

454
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:32,960
He calls the Islamic path Jahiliyah, meaning
the Age of Ignorance. Back in the dark days.

455
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,960
In Arabia and Europe, when someone
conquered you, he would attack your temple.

456
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:41,359
I would come and place idols of my gods.
And worst of all, there were many in society

457
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:45,920
There were also evil practices, like child sacrifice.
According to Islamic texts, in Mecca

458
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:51,359
In fact , a moon god named Hubal was worshipped just near the Kaaba .

459
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:57,040
A bull-shaped metal statue that was hollow inside
. Its hands were as if it were

460
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:01,280
Seeking a sacrifice. This idol
had many grooves. Where your

461
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:06,640
There was a sacrifice offer. If you
brought only flour or sugar, you would get the first batch.

462
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:11,680
Bird to 2, Sheep to 3, Goat to 4

463
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:17,280
Calves to slot 5. Cows or horses
will go into slot 6 and slot

464
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:22,000
Seven were available if you
want to sacrifice your first newborn child

465
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,880
Yes. This ritual was also called Moloch. So
you can see how idols would have become a

466
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:32,160
A symbol of trauma for this culture.
When Zoroaster spoke out against such evil practices

467
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:36,560
He probably didn't know that the small
decision would have the snowball effect.

468
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:41,280
Centuries Later Wood Lead to the Destruction of
This Very Demonic Statue Along With

469
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:45,520
Thousands and Thousands of Other Such
Statues Across All of Arabia Under the

470
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:48,960
Direction of Prophet Muhammad. This is why
Islam has become so strong.

471
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:54,079
Prohibition of giving the Creator any
form. It is seen as an attempt to contain

472
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:59,119
The Infinite. Sadly, the cultists that
Zarathustra helped shape

473
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:04,160
For the same cultists
disproved Zoroastrianism and expelled it from Iran.

474
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:08,960
In India, the Angarasa spirit evolved to
accept every story. You call him Ram,

475
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:13,680
Whether I say Krishna, someone says Durga, someone
says Shiva, we all know him in our own way.

476
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:18,640
They are trying to touch a single element.
Advaita Vedanta has gone a step further.

477
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:23,760
Not only does it say that there is
one God and that that one God is the Creator.

478
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:29,599
But it adds that that One God is the Creation
Itself. You, me, this video, this conversation,

479
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:34,800
It's all the same consciousness. God is not watching
the universe. God is literally the universe.

480
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:39,599
Watching Itself. The monotheism of the West
is the monotheism of a desert. Where scarcity

481
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:44,960
Where order is essential for survival
. Where not being good enough means not

482
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,480
Surviving. Obviously there is no time
for singing and dancing. India's

483
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:53,760
Monotheism on the other hand
is the monotheism of a fertile land where variety of nature

484
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:58,960
This is the default setting. In one area, you'll
find both basil and weed.

485
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:03,200
There will be butterflies and there will be ants.
All contradictions co-exist.

486
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,800
When I started making this video
, I had no idea what

487
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:11,520
The Atharva Veda will teach me so much. I
now realize that it doesn't matter how far apart we are.

488
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:16,160
On some level, we're all deeply connected. If
you're still listening, I know for a long time.

489
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:20,000
It was a video. So thanks for focusing on it for so
long. If you liked the video, please like and comment.
